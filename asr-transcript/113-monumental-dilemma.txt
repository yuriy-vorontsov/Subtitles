Mrs. 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars is down to bottom the hell away from highway and about to cross a really old railroad bridge not an active railroad anymore that's Jack Ludovico wandering around the New Hampshire woods pretty view he's about 10 miles north of the state capital off Interstate 93 in a pretty out-of-the-way place there are no signs or markers on the road indicating something special is that but he sounds so that he gadget is little island and the railroad tracks the straight across but what you really notice is this epic looking granite monument in the middle of the island it looks a lot like a monument you'd see in a city park except it's on a forest that I'm in the middle of the river is enormous it's 30 feet tall well it's all granite and on top of a tall pedestal there's a woman she's wearing this down that falling off her shoulders in her right hand she has a Tomahawk and in her left hand she is a fistful of scalps and on the back of this thing irreverently back here is the inscription now is sponsored the second if you are a regular listener to the show you know how I feel about plaques and always reading them the reason being that plaques tell stories sometimes they told really amazing stories if you can decipher them March 15 the 30th 1697 the war vote Tomahawk Saget and infanticide's right Haverhill the ashes of wigwam campfires at night in a 10 of the tribe are here and another from the yet not a lot of detail their honestly the whole island was strange to me kind of creepy actually not very well kept up this enormous imposing statue with the eerie plaque the scalps what's crazy is this statue was erected in 1874 making it the oldest monument dedicated to a woman in the US so you think someone would come out here at least over the grass now well what I learned is that plaque does tell a story don't not an obvious one and I learned a good reason why the grounds are neglected in fact what to do with this historic site has become a bit of a problem and it all has to do with the woman the monument and what she did the story starts about 50 miles south of the monument in a town called Haverhill Massachusetts I went down there and met up with a local historian named Tom spill Larry in the parking lot of a Dunkin' Donuts a good conversation leads to Tom is a diehard New Englander I'll tell you he's wearing a Boston Red Sox jacket on top of the Boston Celtics jersey on top of the New England Patriots T-shirt guys getting it a little queasy need someone here and everywhere we drive in Haverhill Tom see signs of New England's past particularly from colonial times enter the time a handbasket during that time were embroiled in that some historians are now calling World War I most people would know it as the French in the law what King Phillips King George is in the seven years war in the 1600s New England was a war zone between the French the British and the Americans by the end of that century disease and war would wipe out most Native Americans in the Northeast in Haverhill was the wild West I mean it sounds funny but putting in today's content that's what it was we were the out it was nothing not the last that was it there was nothing but wilderness around making it an easy target for attacks by Native Americans man's of Native Americans had shifting alliances with the British and French the French paid at the neck used of the Britts and bring them to Québec then the Frenchman Celtic Is back in the British it was a slave sunny this area was constantly being constantly in 1697 a woman named Hannah Dustin was recovering from delivering a child without Iraqis rated Haverhill they killed and captured dozens of colonists and burn buildings that's what the word fragments on the money for if I get was a bundle of sticks used to fuel five during the raid had a distance husband was outside with seven other kids defending the homestead of his children but added entries entered the house and abducted Hannah her newborn baby girl and her nurse Mary the captors were marched north to the wilderness centrally after leaving April when Hannah's baby wouldn't stop crying one of the almanac is smashed it against street that's we get the word infanticide from the monuments by they kept walking most psychedelia into the outposts St. Francis that's up in Québec at some point the war party handed Hannah Dustin and Mary Neff to another group of Abba Nikes a group made up of a couple families she was sold those Native Americans as a slave so the group 11 Iraqis it ended up Hannah was made up of two fathers to mothers a grandmother and a bunch of children and he already had a white boy with them a kid named Samuel Leonard sent good been abductive from Worcester the previous year's event makes three-way captives and 12 Avenue the whole group crossed the Merrimack River to the island the one that now is the monument and they set up camp for the night in the middle of the night and a Dustin made a decision she rallied Marion Samuel and let them around the sleeping at an Aggies one at a time a broad hatchet down on the Avenue's heads they killed 10 in total two men two women six children and then before making their getaway they scalped each victim to add the Nikes made it out alive the old woman was injured in a little boy Hannah Mary and Samuel left the island in a canoe it was a dangerous time of year to be on the river it would've been choked with ice and full of rabbits they traveled at night to avoid being seen in 15 days after Van Hannah Dustin and her companions landed in a to the total shock of her husband and her seven children and everyone who ever lost a family member to a rate Hannah Dustin is the woman memorialized in the monument this galaxy is holding in the statute belong to the 10 people including six children that she and her companions killed on the island and that statute isn't the only Hannah Dustin landmark in New England not by a long shot their others particularly in Haverhill where she left Tom Scolari took me in a tour I just pull off you will quickly as they handed us a rest area and possess a spirit I is you listen that he and his and Austin St., Gahanna got the nursing home obviously now I can invest in one years because the name from the monument and if Hannah Botswana Ave., Bosco and is the town in New Hampshire where the island is Tom even took me to an old garrison house for essentially where Hannah Dustin lived after her captivity the new private voice in in a glass case is a piece of Hannah Dustin memorabilia I've seen on eBay in the 1970s the state of New Hampshire commissioned Jim Beam to make a Hannah Dustin whiskey decanter it's an exact replica of the statue New Hampshire down to the little bloody scalps in her hand it's made of porcelain porcelain yet that hits the floor goodbye good night it's kind of sexy and provocative writers that cleavage popping that would never happen back in 1697 do you remember this is in 1976 they did this 1976 it was about selling your selling booze with a sexy women with scalps and an accident and right and we really know what you will look like as there is no photographs of that whiskey decanter is from 1976 but the New Hampshire historical society still sells at Hannah Dustin bobble head in his museum shop on the basin at bottle had it says quote the mother's revenge you can probably see how these kitschy collectors items might feel offensive in fact all the Hannah Dustin stuff and Hannah Dustin landmarks are a problem for some people who know the whole story but the whole story that's a tricky thing to pin down yet understand something with the unit necessary is a lot of interpretation out and is a lot in the folklore Canada since kidnapping and escape happened more than 300 years ago in the story has been told and retold a lot and partly the reason we know anything about it today has to do with the fact that she scalped Herbert after Hannah came home her husband took her and all those at Nike scalps down to Boston to sell them now if you're like me when you heard she had scalped her victims you may have thought she'd some kind of bloodlust I thought scalping or something tribes did to white people not the other way around turns out I was very very wrong colonial governments paid cash for Native American scalps heads and even hand they would pay no sperm in less per woman and least for a time they would even pay Native Americans for the body parts of other Native Americans depending on who was working with the time so Dustin had financial incentive for scalping her victims but teachers the reason we still know the story when Hannah was in Boston selling her scalps she sat down with cotton Mather and he wrote her story down his name might ring a bell cotton Mather was head of the Protestant church in New England he had ties to the Salem witch trials and he was a fire and brimstone minister traveled around giving sermons these little frontier towns that con mother visited they were filled with these shellshocked colonists went missing family members from Native American raids mother told us in story again and again to wrap churchgoers building Dustin's status as a heroine Hannah Dustin story is endorse for so long because it's not just a story about a woman who killed people it actually has become a story about the American nation at different points in time this is Barbara Cutter historian and professor at the University of Northern Iowa it was a story about the colonial battle against Native Americans in the 17th century it was a story justifying the westward expansion of the United States in the 19th century and in more recent years it has been used as a story domestically about culture wars really Carter has researched how and why the Hannah Dustin monuments were built and she's a really hit home just how far the story had traveled when I happened across Salt Lake City Morgan woman's newspaper in the 1890s it started off by saying heard of Canada Augustine was from Massachusetts after her captivity Hannah Dustin lived in colonial obscurity Jackson had seven more kids and died at age 84 no one talked about her through the 1700s she was forgotten until in the 18 teens in the 1820s United States was a new nation and a lot of intellectuals at that point time were trying to create a distinctly American culture and so they started howling American stories and trying to uncover American heroes and heroines so the country's literary elite dug around for some good All-American stories and he found Hannah Dustin Kotter says if you are an American in St. 1865 well the first place you might likely come across her would be when you opened your American history textbook in school you would also come across her story if you read famous American writers like Hawthorne or John Greenleaf Whittier or Henry David Thoreau popular magazines newspapers essay collections children's books paintings in 1800 had a Dustin was a household name Johnny Appleseed Davy Crockett Canada bleach retelling of the story something happened people change the narrative to suit their purposes it becomes a moral problem for Americans that Hannah Dustin killed children especially since any gorgeous children were sleeping children writers omitted details embellished others and sometimes just made things up they completely left out the children she killed replacing them with warriors that at Iraqi child that escaped the writer said Dustin spared him intentionally which there's no evidence of most writers depicted Hannah Dustin as a sympathetic heroine is outraged mother seeking a justifiable revenge this was the era of manifest destiny and then it is America's destiny to inherit the land to season from people dubbed heathens incentives that's when I think New Englanders really started focusing on invest in more and more as the kind of care when they should commemorate in the mid-1800s as headline screamed about the wars in the West monument sprung up in the Northeast when the monument on the island was built in 1874 there were 1000 people present again it was the first monument ever built to a woman in the US but when the Indian wars died down around 1900 Hannah Dustin dropped out of the national spotlight again but a subset of New Englanders held on to her story in 1905 Hannah Dustin's descendents created the Dustin family Association a sort of later the landscape of Haverhill with Memorial boulders and millstones in her honor at sites where she landed her canoe across from where she was very apparently they put one up at one place where he turned around and looked back thinking that Indians might be following her on her way home and all the way into the mid-1900s there was a whole other layer of things named after those frocks and statues a nursing home school streets over time and naming speed out the names themselves stuck and so to the dusty family well my name is Cedric H Dutton Junior on the test generation from Hannah so with that maker of my eighth grade grandmother I'm not sure I just have encountered something like that Cedric is the vice president and formally the president of the Dustin family Association is 88 and he's known about Hannah Dustin since he was a boy to Cedric Hannah was a heroin she is concerned about her own life and those of his companions and as such I thought she was quite a lady to have to pledge you did it do the things you did but basically I think this was self-preservation destroy something clear the dust and family Association is a lobbying for statues anymore they mostly spend time tracing their lineage and to get together for barbecue every summer and Cedric Dustin says he understands why some aren't such a big fan of his grandmother a generations removed but he is disappointed the statue in the island are in disrepair Hannah's nose was shot off of the rifle there's graffiti in the grass has been mowed in years when I was a young man I go to go to bed and got the whole thing but right now page won't let me do that but I think the state of New Hampshire should make good use of the fact that they have in their confines the first statue ever read that the woman in this country by half a new sign should be put at that location indicating that as opposed to the site is still no indicating the date that happened on the island so this is the island the this is the island I went back to the island with the 30 foot tall Hannah Dustin monument with someone who says he's avoided going out there for years should award very her what she looks more like a and opportunists angry opportunists that went back and then brag about it then histories become history this is Paul I'm Paul Puleo Limassol, which is roughly translated the principal speaker of the grand Council of the call at the band of the panic looking at Nikki people Paul doesn't buy cotton Mather's version of the story the one with the Antonetti smashed Dustin's newborn baby against a tree isn't it doesn't mesh with other captivity stories of the era we have many many accounts of captives saying that being taken by the Avenue Nike was not a death sentence many went to Canada some of were traded back Paul thinks Hannah's captors were probably treating her well will presumably as well as one can be treated in captivity and he said that Iraqis revered children so the idea of a warrior bashing a baby against the tree as cotton Mather story betrays sounds unlikely to him it's impossible to know how the baby was killed or how Hannah Dustin was treated by her captors and I hesitate to judge from my 21st-century vantage point what she should or shouldn't have done in order to make her escape but it's clear that the Hannah Dustin story is complicated Paul thinks the monument to her should just be forgotten to mean I really don't think this this monument should be preserved in any way just let it it's the last year for millennia so it's unfortunate here's not going away and that's the problem now Hannah Dustin monuments the one on the island and all the others are mostly feeding relics in out-of-the-way places every few years some politician in our history buff Native American point to one and says anything down or clean this thing up every time people argue Shia heroine or Shia villain the same thing over and over and over just in the last couple months movement renewed talk about the monument people are suggesting putting up additional plaques that show the other night or changing the name from the Hannah Dustin Memorial State historic site to the content cook Islands State historic site but even something as small as cleaning up graffiti on the monument or mowing the grounds could be seen as taking a stance about whether Hannah Dustin deserved a monument in the first place about whether she was actually a hero or villain before we left the island Paul Pouliot said there was something he wanted to do off the record shirt no recording okay he pulled out a drum and some tobacco he paced around the monument twice one time he scattered a little tobacco on four sides of the statue the other time he beat the drum and saying he didn't want me to record the ceremony we talked about it afterwards we don't want to forget parentheses the past so we we did a little watering song and made an offering of tobacco kind of purify the grounds where we were roof walking around and does it provide you with any relief herb satisfaction to do that once what is appropriate you don't just asking Earth mother on your mother taken back and understanding with a synthetic closure in now spiritual closure if nothing else in lieu of any public decision on how to include Paul's ancestors in this history is private ceremony will have to be enough for now the statue with her shot off nose and a haunting plaque remains neglected in crumbling which actually is probably the most accurate symbol of how we feel about Hannah Dustin today ambivalent about who she was but not quite ready to let her go March
