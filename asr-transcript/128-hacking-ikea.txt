This is 99% invisible I'm's IQ is moving and this is one of the show Sean: and yes please said IKEA feel good that it feels this person is a little bit like being a punk member of mainstream given that our audience is you are audience you probably heard of IKEA is the practice of buying stuff from IKEA and then reengineering and hacking into customized more functional and often just way better design stuff in John's case that stuff is 35 foot high shelf Sean has decided upon calyx riding +2 very heavy wooden doors from Home Depot for which he is drilling and screwing altogether into one big beautiful queen sized Frankenstein extortionate secure his basement list New York City existence we are finishing the construction of the there Alex shall become experts have similar the locus of the IKEA hacking movement is a website called IKEA hackers.net to showcase for those who would trick out their calyx lose their article's corpse therefore falls make in both gather tips mother hackers and more importantly post pictures of their own hacks and even a step-by-step guide to how they made them IKEA hackers.net has been in the news a lot lately and not for happy reasons you may read the stories online marketing it into all that later but first I wanted to introduce you to my hacker partner in crime Jonathan for votes in one risk he is an assistant professor at Bucknell University back in 2009 he cowrote a serious academic paper about IKEA hacking with Daniela Rosson are now teaches design at the University of Washington I got interested in part because of how bendable the term IKEA hacking is is Jonathan there was so much scratch the surface about what IKEA hacking could be it could be anything from I bought the shelf at IKEA and it was an inch too long for my closet so I cut in chocolate or we just take a palatable naked into a light and this is Daniela@even actually changing the object itself this is changing its use and at the other end of the spectrum an artist and thunder run.  Did a very provocative work of art which is an IKEA chair reconfigured to look like a stirrup from an unconscious softgels and both of these things fall under the rubric of IKEA hacking that's a really wide rubric and now please put your hands of your children's ears for 20 seconds clearly the axial anti-example you love to a high left to need and I think one song huge trees and product and if on and milk frothing tonight for taking us together and making a little vibrator this is a much racier interview than I was expecting amended technorati aren't just diverse in terms of their sensibility their diverse in the most basic way possible to see hacks posted from all over this country in from Australia Russia Israel by someone posted a hack that the French country house library in an actual French country house used 16 billion bendable cases and he has these before-and-after pictures and explain all how we did it because everything is exactly the same at IKEA no matter where you are it makes it etc. lowers the barriers to re-creating something is this is a think say I wanted to teach year-round and how to build a workbench that you live in Germany and I live in the US if you go and buy a start and would start at a Home Depot in the US Canadian issue 0.5 x 3.5" if you go and buy it would start at Bauhaus German home-improvement store it's going to be a different different size waited to tell me I'm not dreaming and he just said there's a German home-improvement store, just but it's actually Swiss that soap and I know IKEA in spite of itself is the great leveler and it's not very homogenate even McDonald's like sameness from place to place to place that's what's allowing this global community of hackers to thrive that I was dead last game everything and I think probably be eating length pieces at their local store
I like okay make no mistake the actual post themselves than showing your work that's a huge part of this whole thing I think that there is something to this feeling of recognition like you're not creative unless he recognizes being creative if if IKEA is hacked in the forest does it make a sound exactly Adolph Theodore here and I have officially done my first IKEA is currently call and I easily modify and as he makes because a lot of this kind of hacking and showing and telling on YouTube to by now the search term shouldn't be too mysterious by Jack and we are checking out her beautiful IKEA transformation is a dialect called you call them to you in the armchair to measure how far my elbows are the relation of this desk mounted on the mobile content people onto the top of the table and very however installed as clearly as you is in the DMA seat for $44 for the parts from IKEA I'm today and if they're good enough to do some frankly pretty remarkable things with these materials like why aren't they just going in dying ground numbers and screws and nails and hammering together something may be more lasting and less press party hacking and chance at a hacking at the hacking the brand hacking but that Brown actually symbolizes beyond the stories were put another way to grow Danielle and Jonathan their mocking the modularity of IKEA think this stuff is so tinker toy I can mix and mash up the hell out of it it also goes back to that homogeneity right that if this is the McDonald's of furniture I'm limited go against the grain and make a double triple extra pickle big Mac with no middle bonnet rated part of your identity at that that that point you're saying I'm a person who transforms things that this is where it gets even more complicated according to Jonathan within that group of people who wanted to to completely transform something some of them really wanted to maintain a key aesthetics of everything this is something we want to say that could have come from IKEA but didn't so there's assertive sense of sure you want express yourself but you're also trying to sort out due to do when you try to outwit IKEA right way I like your IKEA I lay the shelves down on their side way that I we now rejoin this idea already as everyone we have built three Alex shall you be leaving down on their sides kind of you it's like my bed is a whale skeleton land size and you be putting stuff in the rib cage.

Blow to the long-running family want her stop according to a blog post published by founder chewables he issued a cease-and-desist order in March this is the news that we alluded to at the beginning around the same time that Sean and Jonathan were hacking together his bed unbeknownst to them a brand protection company wrote to the Queen bee of IKEA hack them the woman who runs IKEA hackers.net tools yet Jules is in her real first name the letter Bisbee said that IKEA was not amused and that of Jules didn't stop operating a website the way she was she could be in big trouble if Jules and I are you and it wasn't until the news broke about the cease-and-desist letter the jewels agreed to talk to me she was a Malaysia we talk by Skype before he had on a business or just curious how she thought up the site so I was the new home decor websites and I found a a few thanks this scattered around on the Internet and that was that I thought completed with easily could see all these hiking one place no I was a delightful design on N/A I knew had so that was in 2006 and for some reason only this year 2014 March 12 to be precise D jewels get an email in the subject line this is notification is not the how so I got my dream really know I love it was then scary since when did they wanted to do and hand over the domain name stop using the IKEA trademark or anything trademarked by IKEA which I think means even pictures of the furniture and she have to close down her twitter and Facebook accounts to all the social media stuff that the about this the thing that I didn't understand right away was the Jules as a key action she's just as huge fan I some it strikes me that it's like needing a celebrity that you always really love and
that celebrity is really mean you use why can't you hear will you I know that I have been given a restraining on hilarity after jewels announced on her website that big changes might be coming to IKEA hackers the story went viral people are really pissed off Cory Doctorow who blogs on Boing Boing famously called the cease-and-desist letter load steaming the bold" at this point Jules who was pretty much resigned she got the best thing to do is just to comply in then transfer the hacks over to another site which didn't have IKEA's name on it if nothing else she was grateful that so many people reacted so strongly to the news so he was on a Friday night that an announcement and the following week I received a call from I keep from IT guy named Anders West knee bouncing the right he's with the business side of things as opposed to the legal side he was in background that lawyers and you get job in a and heels of the the this event is deflected and see it back she didn't recognize ICANN really he said that if it landed in it didn't happen that spirit up we easily accessible everyone and to that and he told jewels that they wanted to find another way forward and try to figure out how they can resolve things did come to some agreement is call me I was the only feature I like hell yeah yeah is a that is the life me you know I something I doing the IKEA dance and get this as we are releasing this podcast Jules is visiting Sweden and Holland meeting face-to-face with representatives of IKEA two during the concept center where their products are developed and then visiting the very homeland where it all began it's like she's Charlie bucket visiting Willy Wonka's chocolate factory yet I have no EE global immediate sense that am thank you whatever truly partner with Jules and make her some sort of the minister of hacking or whatever I've been saying is like and I can imagine IKEA could possibly endorse any individual hacker hacking on the voice is too risky enough and if someone goes wrong I mean it basically be sanctioning what amounts to a misuse of their products even though I will say that misuse eels and therefore (I have to tell you is I I the feeling of hacking together my IKEA bed well I and Jonathan Bean as it was really mostly him but we you know created something at and that thing that we created is now something that I sleep on every night a it's a such a powerful feeling who is it.
