This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars recognize the possibilities of nuclear war in the miscellaneous without our citizens knowing what they should do and where they should go the problems begin to fall be a failure of responsibility and that of course is Pres. John F. Kennedy BT on July 25, 1961 during the crisis one of the various moments in the Cold War where we came very very close to engage in actual with the self tomorrow I am requesting funds for the following immediate object to identify unlocked the existing structured public and private that could be used on children stock social what first aid kit and other minimum meticulous Rossa five basically when committees.  It's a real possibility bombs innocent following need to figure out where you can all go to take shelter that's producer dating and after committee name is horrifying speech as you can imagine phones started ringing immediately the Kennedy administration was besieged by people wanting more information on the fallout shelters I'm Kenneth D rose I wrote one nation underground the fallout shelter in American culture you businesses that had previously been making swimming pools now declare themselves to be experts at building shelters they were door-to-door bomb shelter salesman shelter displays of malls and county fairs by the time Kennedy made the 1961 speech there was one place that already broken ground on the unique shelter I teasing the next account population 11,000 about 40 miles south of Roswell in the southern part of the statement Texas and in 1953 they opened a brand-new elementary school completely underground to the morgue decontamination showers and stockpile food and medicine in the school was built to double as the town's nuclear fallout shelter this was a pilot program with the idea of protecting the schoolchildren and also members of the community and picture was a nuclear attack during an attack to school" supposedly would shelter some students and those from other schools or the first 2100 people to show up at those who arrived late to school would find their entry blocked by 1500 pounds to two hours I is and it is 821 and joining us in the studio this morning's Katie mingle she's a from Oakland California and the good work.  Thanks okay first of August when what is going on a let me explain I went to please them and because all towns are uneven and made me to come on their local radio station KS VP put a call out for people who had gone out of elementary school as kids good dose of anybody who is has information or stories were sure about Avalon and attribute a student there were administrator or maybe worked on whatever I give Katie: skin her from the resistance of the people actually call you had a day will meet one of the later but first let's go look at the school others to a quiet little neighborhood not to file a friend center of town you can easily miss driving license is mostly underground that there is a sign out you have to squint to make it out but it says although elementary school and fallout shelter and that's course original on there that Scott Simon my name is Scott Sima and I am currently the director maintenance for the public schools for two public schools and and set the current assistant superintendent and IKEA schools on the roof of on the school is closed now against the wood school there until 1995 the roof after school is a concrete blacktop at ground level with value and 300 stairways that go down underground and school like if you're in first grade he went down this the set of doors if you're in second and third you come over here and in fourth and fifth graders
up at this one one mother described the scene of kids entering the building as looking like ants lining up to go into there and help combat actually both went to school and handling the late 70s early 80s make I met even on the sign out front because I let something and even though their school was entirely underground they never really knew I never knew growing up that it was a built is a bombshell services to school to me as a kid in a and then once you get older you you hear stories and always to have a more elementary was designed thing I can kind civil defense.  Named Frank and tired after he built out of school he went on to design underground shopping mall/shelter that was never actually built over here there is is shower contaminants often you before you come into the people the decontamination showers at each entrance were easy to miss as with the Black stars which were swung up against a wall and not used during normal school days solid steel door you can close it has through latches to a lot so nobody can get in or out and never move it distorts us to cluster working here we get a couple flights of stairs to the main hallway at the school and basically it just looks like a school I mean it's windowless and kind of drab since I haven't been used in almost 20 years that otherwise it looks a bit like other schools at NN and dictionary whenever he came to launch from the class is yours came to this door Agassi back there they had a big stage back there were put on her productions for I was in a few plays that during the very graceful so that's that's where it all happened the gifted Abu accident the boat on what the school mascot would be inappropriately and adorably they chose to be the Apple logo first started it yet we were underground dissecting gophers are in so and here is a our generator of to keep it up and running for the people that are coming in the inhabitants or whatever else people that are come here for the fallout and also has out of your records on water well underground and as you can tell right here you get door to get a quote that viable openness for survival ship ventilation shafts and ventilation shafts can keep Panera in and weren't sure which doubled as more and I think it's backed by the elevator there's little room but it you never see Rick it you know a tremendous number of bodies this typical classroom certainly not any Windows is not in sunlight with we went upstairs to three times a day for the recreation the teachers reported that they generally liked her school because the students weren't distracted by starting out the windows and I think the students themselves were generally proud of other school but once again this creates a huge debate with many people saying that the needs of schools and the need to shelter people during a nuclear attack were not compatible that says again I have one nation under God and he says in fact there was a lot of debate going on at the time about follow-ups updates the subject was virtually inescapable in the early 1960s every newspaper was running articles on shelters and the potential for survival time magazine published an article called guns are nasal in which they interviewed a guy who said data save his neighbors tried to get into its fallout shelter there were a nuclear attack he would kill them philosophy of going to staggeringly to protect their families greatest today you can watch shows like doomsday propers on cable TV and think about what it would be like to prepare for the apocalypse but in the 1950s and 60s it was a brand-new idea also and it was a strange idea I mean the president of the United States is telling people to build these things in the whole country was involved in the debate on one side of the debate you had people against shelters those against shelter said that your good people who Bert burled into the ground to save your own scans are no better than moles or gophers shelters would militarize America and turn the United States into a garrison state and after the nuclear warhead ended shelters would sort of be America's pyramids all that remained of wasted the Fox civilization and on the other side people for shelters said Lehman and this is just a precaution like any other vacant head polish updates to life but here's a sarcastic letter that a proponent of shelters wrote to the Harvard Crimson 1961 there's been brought to our attention that certain elements among the passengers and crew favors the installation of lifeboats on the ship although we share their concerns we remain unalterably opposed to any consideration other course of action for the following reasons the letter gets increasingly sarcastic it demonstrates a lack of faith in our captain the apparent security which lifeboats offer will make our navigators reckless these proposals will distract our attention from more important things i.e. building unsinkable ship you will only be saved for a worse fate inevitable death on the open seas so forth and so I think in the soul letter you can see some of the issues being debated like what kind of world will you emerge to if you survive a nuclear war and whether the shelter system could somehow make our leaders more likely to engage in more is a very complicated calculus on this this whole issue of whether to build a shelter or not to build a shelter for the town of Artesia in the early 1960s the calculation seemed easy enough they needed a new school anyway and the office of civil defense agreed to pay the difference between building a regular school and a fallout shelter school Artesia was near Walker Air Force Base is close now but at the time it was the largest strategic air command base of the U.S. Air Force it was also close to the White Sands missile Range these and other factors made Artesia feel particularly vulnerable to attack New Mexico has always had nuclear programs going on that's John Olympians have friends mom this one of the people that hurt me on the radio and got in touch John went on the elementary in the 1960s when Cold War tensions were still really high I do remember and going through White Sands missile Range every once in a while you see a missile going up music and while have to do a 30 minutes deliverable I'm a creepy feeling like Saturn sky that gave me the to learn about Johnny didn't not faced by her school is underground the teachers never mentioned it and her parents and tell either Intel is anything and don't ask real questions the lighting that you almost can't have that one friend in elementary school that knows about sex love John Dalia Brennan and she knew about nuclear war the daily Brandon I'll never forget she's want to open my eyes to that Dennis I guess reality and reality she was very intelligent cars they had fallout shelter in their backyards am sure they had Artie Continental survivalist thing growing up in the no knowing the kids and her family seems like they were taught things like how you can survive nuclear holocaust and I know I had to have a freaky feeling about that after that I got my guys rounded by I love you nice talking outlines the sky emergency text alignment oil refinery plays every Monday at 6:30 PM the keys is a large oil refinery was another thing made them feel vulnerable to refineries are often targets turned horses versus the ones that he will like the one in Artesia is like a nuclear range and intimate Diana Hyland Lucy was done on the message in when I was dealt and got a fair amount of media content Dan Rather did a story on the CBS evening news in 1962 and more than 60,000 people toward the school and its first few years the Soviets found out about it hypocritical one Moscow newspaper criticized adhesions for indoctrinating pupils to the inevitability of war that actually while the rest of the country's students were doing… ICal is probably strange and scary for some 10th China doesn't ever remember having the one on the 8.we never did any email like nuclear rate test oriented drop tech and roll Malik on his staff regarding down there with percent so be sure to remember what the total ducted fans because everyone of us must remember to do the same thing as with this film is all about duck and cover this is an official civil defense film produced officials in the Soviet Union were putting down the US for their preoccupation with that so shelter issue but in fact the Soviets built a very elaborate secret shelter underneath Moscow and of course our fearless leaders had their own hiding places the most elaborate one being the bunker hidden below the Greenbrier resort in West Virginia build the house all 535 members of Congress and their staff but not their families it was decommissioned in 1995 and is now open for tours and the speech that we heard beginning of this story in which any that allocate millions of dollars to find places where Americans can take shelter from nuclear bomb it took place in July 1961 I you will in the fall of 1962 during the Cuban missile crisis Kennedy asked for a status report and found that his filter program was armed on schedule the government had many will find all the places where people could take shelter ones they had felt fully stocked with supplies I think he is also but it wasn't in decline because Americans stop being afraid war Cuban missile crisis was arguably the most writing Americans rejected shelters were a lot through an appointment something was about $25 and not that the median family income 1960s and Dr. is also going Americans simply did not like the image of themselves cowering underground I think it dog at American pride we think roughly something like 200,000 shelters were built from the beginning of the Cold War to about 1965 and you could say that well 200,000 nuts a lot of shelters to about one for every 900 people but in an era where the majority of Americans actually believes that there was going to be nuclear war between the US and the Soviet Union and I would say the 200,000 business is actually a small number I will not go down under the ground for some of her testimony that have come around that will not carry myself down in the but the and I live in 11 – the method steps variable load under the that is as far as Apple elementary is thankfully never had to serve as a fallout shelter and they got rid of their supplies back in 1989 irritable the bedding in the food the medicine even if you body bags the school stayed open until 1995 when they stopped using it as a school it wasn't because they were tired of being underground here's assistant superintendent accepts and it is sad after growing growing up in the school to see if this is not being used here to see it in this type of shape that we understand as a as a district in the cost to renovate this type of building was was more then than what the community was willing to to put into and so we built a brand-new school run on almost on top of it is just slightly to the West the new school was called Jesu elementary D7 Abell are both named after geological layers of earth you so being in the layer just above Abbott clipper yay so is above ground that in the spirit of Hannah elementary has very few windows now I'm a elementary is used for district storage oh and one other thing to being used as a active shooter training facility for the federal law enforcement training Center they go through all their scenarios and in use it to practice for for situations that none of us want to think what happened in high school shootings that you can open around the nation this is been a a really silly to use that it's all downstairs no windows and get everything they need to do and only as advise him on federal law enforcement training Center building on the practices shooting running drills hiring a tiger so there is a fair obviously never) you as is there's
