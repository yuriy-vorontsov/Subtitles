thing about easier I do the continent they made the ancient the thing really aren't at all the place out this Woody's tunnels do with this thing his curiosity to another ruin sleep in a relationship after another; and that's about it this is a story in John Martini 19 he wrote a book about this place called sutras glass Palace so named because this pool of water used to be underneath an enormous glass structure it was the pet project about all sutra the name Sutro might sound familiar to you especially if you live in San Francisco there is Sutro Towers Sutro Heights is a Sutro Library at the same Cisco State University all named after this one German immigrant he struck it rich by engineering a mining tunnel during the Nevada silver strike and 1860s and he turned his money into San Francisco real estate a lot of real estate some historians estimate at one point out of Sutra owned one 12th of the city NFC countless to San Francisco with John D Rockefeller was to New York and let Henry Huntington was telling each of the public gardens presented free concerts and build the structure that would eventually become Citrobacter sutras original idea was that he wanted to build a giant outdoor aquarium that would be filled by the tides and it was empty at low tide so in 1884 he created a catch basin that refilled naturally as the waves broke in and then Sutro kept making more and more plans adding on and on to his aquarium he built a network of swimming pools connecting canals even built a powerhouse freestanding building to keep the water then what all that was done then he hires architectural firm assembly would be like if some crazy self-improvement guide built the foundation for an elaborate house didn't know it has to look like he just built foundation and he plumbed it and any hierarchy for me to make building it on top was already there that Democrats were designed from the@Sutro baths look like an ornate palatial greenhouse underneath its majestic three-tiered glass canopy were several different swimming pools hot water and cold saltwater and fresh and there were more than 500 individual changing rooms beneath the sweeping arena style bleachers and attached to the bath was a museum full of sutras crazy collection of stuff from around the world needs your boat model building taxidermy animals can mechanical figures a real addiction money all inside any glass Palace facing the ocean at the head to San Francisco they have the road was a street called Mary Lane there are the first live basically offer along with a roller coaster and hall of mirrors and games of chance think even my Sutro was building at the age of nowhere on the rocks privacy in public transit didn't go there and this is a challenge for both construction workers and for customers have lost money from the day it opened it was huge white elephant and cost a lawsuit throw about $1 million when it opened in 1894 and you keep with affidavits and 37 $40 million it could make money from the charging people at $.10 to get Internet 50 just SOA it would had to be packed almost every day and in an attempt to house Sutro pouring even more money into electric rail lines that let out to that this is a huge boon for the city's mass transit at the same time ever healed all the land surrounding them to be really traveling through and there were always advertisements for the central land company they find something so he's doing things for the public at the same try and make something that Sutro baths just never ever made money but the time and a future was elected mayor in 1894 his beloved bats were still not turning a profit when he died four years later in 1898 his family started looking to get rid of the property this teacher family tried 40 years to sell Sutro baths while also trying valiantly to make it turn a profit in 1934 my father was hired by it also chose a grandson of the pioneer it also drove just about that time it also joined to do something to get more people out here eagerly Sutro baths may run into Tom Bradley but as time run them now I volunteer for the Metroparks and the commander once a week and for few hours and not talk to people and let them know just exactly what always ruins are about Tom's father was an engineer and he helped Sutro baths undergo it's really wiggy midlife crisis they cut off the bottom pool cut that off from the writer pool drain to scatter sand around put in some tables ping-pong tables in picnic tables and they call that the covered the the tropical beach was supposed to be a warm sandy place endorses to hang out even though the real beach was right outside that are related or it out to will which it really is a shame because right outside the beach is raising and usually fogging a tropical version is that crazy and so they said well, this will take that dropping reach away and will put a platform where and will make that into a nicer and when Tom was in high school his father got him a job working at this very answering yes Tom worked in this place will still stand which seems impossible given how ancient Romans look people will really come up to visit were these really ruins from Rome and I say not really routed all Tom's is being a nice anytime Tom was employed there the name of the place had changed from Sutro baths to just sutras the pseudo family had finally gotten rid of his place in 1952 when entertainment tycoon George Whitney bought it when he was the boss when Tom Bradley started as a locker attendant and even more than the suture family George Whitney was really trying to do everything he could to get people to come out so we tacked on more amusements including a ride high above the sea that shuttled between the two cliffs on either side of sutras he called it the sky train the sky tram this and hold about 20 people took about 20 minutes ago across to really make a lot of money on it when he also got an aviary may bring in the so he ordered some exotic.  Vincent Cajuns what happened was all the birds came in at once before the cages so they had that when he called all the employees is is okay everybody here to go home to call a bird into old arcade is coming then when you merge back by even after the ice rink and aviary and the sky tram people still weren't coming the sutras the Whitney's after struggling for 14 years decided to sell the property historian John 19 again it was sold to a land developer began to demolish it and the engine 60 6S on the very convenient fire in 1966 a mysterious fire broke out and reduce to trust to a pile of rubble and arsonist was suspected that no one was arrested and then you chose was never rebuilt eventually the last owner sold the land National Park Service 1980 so it's part of a big national Park area Sutro baths is right inside Golden gate national recreation area the government finally bought it it was seamlessly included into this big national Park area it's not a national park itself and it doesn't look like it belongs within the Golden gate national Parks Conservancy at all it just looks like a bunch of Romans sometimes rules are more evocative… The site is restored as much as this is the real deal even though these are only 45 years old have the same attraction that first traded explain but what people are looking at so unlike other ruins remains of Sutro baths are less than 50 years old they are part of a national park since 2012 they do have their own tiny museum and gift shop on-site by long merry way with a midway to study history son still there and yet the ruins are still pretty dangerous and many people still mysterious at this point you may be wondering how yet the baths or about parking availability or maybe if you can go hold your photo shoot that Joe can

was just pretty much the closest to a magical place iPod as an adult and I fell in love I think I will/there after I die I want to you actually did bury her cute pet lizards there there in the case the story of Sutro baths didn't exactly shape history visit helped expensive disco public transit yes you can see the briefly seen in the movie Harold and Maude but ultimately it was a strange class complex at the edge of the ocean was destined to fail and amusements and attractions were constantly added and removed throughout its life the NSC is rapidly gentrifying a San Francisco in a country as young as the United States these rulings are an anomaly a respectable desire for it to be like his mysterious unknown thing by my dear tourist talking to stay there wondering like a have been known
