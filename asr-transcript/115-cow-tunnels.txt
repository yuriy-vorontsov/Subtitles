This is 99% invisible my Roman martyrs of his horse and this is part of the show Sean: and that was 3911 is of course a horse-drawn carriage of course there are just reinforces wandering around Manhattan those are probably worried someone that I am actually going to meet a woman target has it's hard to believe now this area is really industrial the best depot but this part of Manhattan westernmost part say 34,300 this was cow country so were talking the late 19th and early 20th centuries good cattle being herded across 12 Avenue which is now the W. Side Hwy., Nicola Twilley is a woman I wanted to talk to that house she writes a blog called edible geography and from Avenue selling a channel hair showing how money is gravy get along little doggie and cows were brought to this part of down to be made into beef before the meatpacking district this was like the meatpacking district Eric nickname have expired late anyway I found the boiler is an I serious and large renderers that this you can picture it would've been a disassembly line for every single part of now the chasm be ferried across the Hudson River from New Jersey public elbow and landed the docs here in the first you know merging a few cows across 12 Avenue to the slaughterhouse was fine you can hold up traffic for that but then came more and more And more folks in their carriages and in the drinking through in cars on the thing out there and handing have visited hey then found there were ever quite this bank couch and on 12 Avenue and Mikhail Jim looked like sort of and you and he gets people like in other cases cows and cowboys and cowgirls they can't talk them it was no longer few modern life them so so is what we're here to talk about today can neither here we go that's why people invent things like accountant how to count best Richard against how title 10 whenever you say it's funny to them tunnels how tunnels in Manhattan for his neglect on the piece you wrote for Gizmodo the loss how tunnels of New York City and when it was says the people invented things like the Tunnel for the purposes of the story that really could mean one of two things either people invented tunnels to march the cows underneath 12 Avenue to the abattoir for people invented this crazy cock and bull story that the count tunnels more moment cock in this case because everybody loves a good vaguely plausible urban myth and so negligently has been on a years long quest to figure out whether the count tunnels never actually existed because after all the idea of cows loping along under your feet in New York City at least how we think of New York City now he's insane and this is one of writes a blog that generally about food and place and if anything exists and that same intersection it is the how tunnel dedicated infrastructure for animals it's a new genre of architecture exactly how tunnel when you think about all and they tubes in and tunnels and weird things that are underneath the street we have tells the cars it tunnels for subways we have all these tubes filled with electrical cables in the Internet and all this I mean the cows have their own subterranean infrastructure to Nicholas first happened on the Story by chance and I is reading a book called raising stakes by Betsy for sell its fossil actually stakes of course is billed as TE AKS yet the kind that could be porterhouse or area yet strictly bound exactly or sirloin any any of the above Stripling-round pick the skirt she's reading along loses one little passage on page 22 you could miss it quite easily if you are reading too fast excessive to
thing Angel says traffic was so heavy in 1870s and account tunnel" with and capitalize actually was built beneath 12 Avenue to serve as an underground passage and it's rumored to be there still awaiting designation of landmarks then she just carries not as late as 1880 4X… What is literally one sentence exactly and that's weird and wonder if they still there so I googled it then would design I found Brian Witt tried think is how you pronounce his name yeah that's however doesn't bring the bread is a utility specialist for widening her Associates in New York with the structural engineering firm what I do for widening areas figure out how to get from point a to point B underground in New York City when con Edison is cutting a transfer electrical cables they need a navigator as well as investigate all kind of anomalies and strange things that they find underground when doing things so Brian went searching for the truth about how tunnels more than 10 years before Nicola in 1997 he published an article in a local local newspaper called the Tribeca grand which is what Nicola found in her web search the headline was thumbs steer I will summarize it here Brian talking to a con Ed worker named Fred just read this thread is a hen friend says he was watching a work crew install a new drainage basin downtown which is by the way nowhere near the side of those old slaughterhouses a date and Dagan and finally they had this kind of pain barrier would the breakthrough it and it's hollow on the other side and then a quote unquote old man from the neighborhood steps up and says I see you found the house tunnel so Brian walks the story around the whole mess of people and everybody's heard of the cow tunnel but when they talk about it the facts are never the same that a somewhat different in beads made of different items and Steve was dealt at a different time and when Brian finally circles back to Fred Fred says well actually I never saw it was a buddy - so again that's O'Brien told the story in his article in 1997 sitting in his office with me in 2014 he told it this way we were digging contest pits for Verizon weight but so so sincere daily you are there digging and and right and so we dug down to 5 feet and is Rick curved surface that looks like a vaulted roof so now the story has completely changed in Brian's mind suddenly she's the one watching the work crew not Frederick and in this telling the blockage they hit while digging is brick not lead any talk this way for another 10 minutes before he finally stopped and said Wednesday
these are calling the beginning of this comes like checkers sworn I saw these regularly make the article I didn't the same dancing friend in Andrea mother tell you how big it is where Joseph Isaac held old everyday man I started doing the same damn thing this is what happens at the Cal Thomas and why the truth of them is so hard to get a hold of it's like as soon as you start to retell the story gets loose begins to bend it's like an instant fishtail except it's about cows and somehow the folklore of it just stretches further and further out until nobody can remember how the story started and so when Nicola Twilley wrote her first blog post about the catcalls in 2010 she went solely off of Brian's article which uncovered nothing and that one line in the Betty Fussell book around the same time she had published a little shred of hard-ish evidence popped up the countable version of the shroud of Turin it's a coffee table book called New York in the 19th century having here yes it is a picture in here that shows this is in 1877 in grazing from Harper's weekly Alec how tunnel at 34th St. cattle being driven up through a tunnel signal with a tunnel answers tunnel from the dock I emerging from it some regular time on this account in there with a little with keeping the moving and there strung up by 1 foot and since some fairly executed on their exactly the rest of the Chittagong Congress but the house of that seems to be as evidentiary right there is a picture of account final thing okay about that that Mrs. Nicola Twilley again and mean you can actually see where the tunnel is how emerging from a title engraving not a photograph this account emerging from its life the cowboy in the picture is about to fit talus is all kinds of problems with the cow is about 10 times his size that was in buying and I needed more he needed more so she did what she says bloggers like her never do when the researching a topic she called people to hear that city's director of archaeology and she said of that out this size if she'd been asked this question before I really do I read about in the race time that sort of bubbled up on a key blog thin ice does is before exiting a job and called her – she had said what Japan probably what she said to me which they now evident never found anything in the woman's leg when you talk to the head of the Greenwich Village Society for historic preservation at the meatpacking District deserved it and you burn and a nice day politics sorry no evidence G Now I Am about to Really Slowly Write These Things As When I Decide to Call CC Saunders of Historical Perspectives Incorporated Which Basically Consults with Big Projects Construction Projects and That Sort of Thing in the Gauge Whether There's Historical Archaeological Important Stuff In the Area for a Stuffed into My Might Dumb down Lehman's Take on It She Called Me Back from the Ferry On the Way Back in Staten Island's Defending a Dank Exist No Question Don't Be Really Feel It Also Is the Blueprint Simulator After All This There Are Blueprints You Original at This Point and That I Have a Copy That We Put into Our Report That We Gave Only Studied the Reconstruction Athlete Nine Antilife Nine Is the Last Thing Highway This Is Not CC Saunders@Celine Schneiderman Had Never Been Seeking Honors Work with Her for about 20 Years And CC Said Celine Was Basically the Cow 10 Alien at the Shop so Back in 1991 the State Contracted Historical Perspectives to Do and Historical Study of That Former Meatpacking Area at 12 Avenue in the Upper 30s Is When the State Was Looking to Redo Route 98 and Celine Wrote the Report so She Did a Time of Research but Did All These Old Maps and Documents and Built-Up This Picture of The Kind of Structures That Used to Be along 12 Avenue There on Tenants Warehouses Cattle Panels I Stop Right There on the Very Very Last Page of the Liens Report about That Meatpacking Area Page 28 Pitches Reviewed What It Says Sure about and Iran Had a Pass on This Building Is That Pennsylvania Ballet Company Extended Naturally Feet beneath 12th Ave. in the Shoreline for the Block between Last 38 – 39th St.-Eye Diagram Am Back in 1991 It Was Not Meant to Say That It Was 200 Feet beneath 12th Ave. If It's Right If You Live and Many Behalf in His Place Not Hire and External Lift out in 1932 and He Said the President Wait a Minute 1932

The Buildings without Having to Excavate the Roadway Itself I Do Now Arriving There Is The W. Side Hwy. construction Leaving That the Javits Center at the Lincoln Tunnel That Were Standing Right Next Day Most Likely Discount Tunnel There Was Once upon a Time It Was Pulverized and All of That Construction In Any Void As Filled in the Week so You Have a Blueprint of It so He Knows Icy Built-Ins and Just Plain but on Other Maps That Were Made of the Area Later Boxee in and It's in the 1950s Report Series from the Army Corps Of Engineers Which I Don't Really Know What That Means but There Is an Ad Actually Enter Research Nicholas on Evidence for That Other Tunnel at 34th St. Was in the Harpers Weekly Picture This Is New York Times Article from 1875 the Talks about It It Says There Ones a Tunnel under 12th Ave. for the Animals Are Brought into the Shambles In Fact The Cattle Are Never Seen by the outside Public from the Time of Their Landing until They Are Converted into Beef and Practicing If It's a Pivotal Moment We're Beginning to Become Completely Detached From Where Our Food Comes from This Is Needed Yes Cities Are Becoming Things That Somehow Get Sad Mysteriously and Invisibly at This Precise Moment Want an Account Tunnel on Historic Importance in Boston That Also Known As Either It Exists or Not Au Contraire Nicola Twilley Oh Country so Ate the Train Right Now Is Going through What Used to Be a No We Do Know Whether the Catalan Boston Exists It Does except It's in Cambridge Mass. I Stood on a Bridge of about It with Charlie Sullivan Other Ways Away This Never a Development The Cattle Market Was Established over on Massachusetts Avenue Quite Early before the Railroad Came through And Farmers Would Drive the Cows Here Over the Roads Charlie's the Head of the Cambridge Historical Commission He Says There Used to Be Cow Pens on Either Side of This Bridge the Walden Street Bridge and How Tunnel On the Walden Street Cattle Pass Was Built so Farmers Could Drive the House from One Pen to Another Data Wanted Let Them Loose on Walden Street So Because They Might Because They Would Get Loads Like Loosely As They Made like No Other Slips San Juan into Harvard Square and How the Cappuccino of Kyle Right to Cows Have Minds of Their Own Anyway Discount Tunnel Is Now on the National Register of Historic Places But Other Than a Plaque and Mentioned That You Never Know It Was Tucked underneath the Railroad Bridge Off-Limits to the Public Next to an Active Rail Line Which Is Fenced off So That People Don't Get Hit by Trains so in Short the Commission Preserve the Structure That No One Can See You Have Any Access to Correct the Only Way Is to Have Try to Hop the Fence Joined in They Find It Would Be Fun Interesting Way to Spend a Morning I'm Not Sure That I'm Able to Do It Okay That's Okay So but Feel Free Please Tell Me You Happens without Please Donate It Happens without a Sound Too Wonderful so When Charlie Was Well Out Of Sight and Couldn't Be Accused of Aiding and Abetting Yes I Am in for Climbed on the Steep Embankment through All These Thickets Only God.
