<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-family: Times;">It's the tag radio hour from NPR and I rise and our show today from curiosity discovery like most kids when James was a kid he was curious to go looking for tadpoles or salamanders butterflies anything that moved her fluor crawled or swam and I could catch it went up in my collection and that included the microbiological specimens as well I got a microscope for Christmas when your temple pond water and creating slide someone without a complete science and it was quite creative on how to get the cells like to get a life kids living in a certain point at that kind of curiosity starts to disappear after this date on this and studies on this but obviously the is a very high degree of neural plasticity in the young young minds young brains that the that seems to to decay on a curve that will have dreams of flying I think when work when we're kids and we tend to lose that as well it's almost like the more we know about the world the limits of what what's possible start to crowd in on us for some reason that never really happened to James treasury even as I'm saying and cringing Emily grew up that sense of curiosity he became a defining part of his professional work as a filmmaker I I I his film Titanic became the second highest grossing movie ever and is grossing film he made that one to you are not in cases anymore avatar fuel run Pandora ladies and gentlemen respect the fact in his idea for avatar exit came before Titanic but the time and this was the early 1990s James Cameron felt like the technology wasn't quite there yet to make it the way you want to make as he explained on the 10th stage so I shall the limit as other movie about pictures of six has you a live fish into the studio is Romeo and Juliet on a ship it's good to be this epic romance passionate film secretly what I wanted to do was elegant dive to the real rack of Titanic and asked why they promote fairness of most video didn't know that but I convince than I said Morgan a guide to the record and fill it for real using it in the opening of the film the really important great marketing hook and I talked them into funding an expedition you okay drop down a first-class gangly sort of what you guys were completed so if you remember those opening scenes from Titanic there's real footage of shipwreck in James Cameron's film footage himself he went two and half miles below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean Alan now that was already tons of footage of the Titanic James Cameron could have used that in the movie but you really want to see in himself I think you know I've said jokingly but I think his low truth to the idea that I probably made that movie because I believed I could actually die to the Titanic and if I could've actually dived to the Titanic without making a movie I probably would've done that and so what started out as a serious impulse became a catalyst for discovery to go to the deepest parts of the oceans to film and then turn that footage into documentaries every dive I've ever been on I've seen something I haven't seen before and on a few of those dives I've seen things that nobody seemed I caught bearing witness wanting to literally go and see photographing it came later but it was just him wouldn't that be cool today on the show from curiosity to discovery stories dreamers for scientists and still makers about the source of curiosity and how it drives the things they do later in the show James Cameron returns with his journey from Phil maker to explore back at first this is the story of the guy this is from the BBC annotation of the series the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams in deep inside one of the chapters of one of the books in the series" I guess is not just the client is the kind of situation for quite describes this is honestly I'm a designer and promise that kind of chest with this one quote a few years ago it's a point in the book where the main character Arthur Dent this Monday normal kind of in a guy from South London like me finds himself</p>

<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-family: Times;">but someone in a 200 years ago I made a small incremental improvement to a process which is kind of long forgotten really on but that has kindly contributed in some way to where we are today but the whole history of humanity can to everyone who's ever lived to kind of be found in this mundane item tasting bread Thomas writes you should really see his toaster and his top hat.com by the way did plug it in one sparks flew it overheated and it burned out in about five seconds but in it was sold to an art museum wouldn't it pay for it 20,000 pounds to get a cut of that I showed and I rise our show today from curiosity to discovery listening to radio our from NPR it's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm die rise and on today show from curiosity to discovery and how one often leads to the other but sometimes discovery isn't really an endpoint its years of false starts that easily lead to a tiny breakthrough on this unknown is someone of the zebra Hunter this is Wendy Chong she said genetic researcher and pediatrician when people hear of beats we same medicine should usually think of horses rather zebras spent many times families come to me after they've been to a lot of doctors for horses and can come up with answers and seven (something more unusual or more esoteric when he is actually more of a genetic detective in the case she's been trying to crack for more than 20 years autism here's the opening from Wendy's why why is the question you ask me all the time why did my child develop autism as a pediatrician as a geneticist as a researcher we try and address that question that autism is not a single condition actually a spectrum of disorders a spectrum that ranges for instance from Justin 13-year-old white was nonverbal who can speak who communicates by using an iPad to touch pictures to communicate thoughts and his concerns a little boy who when he gets upset will start rocking and eventually when he's disturbed enough for banging his head to the point that he can actually cut it open and wire stitches that diagnosis of autism now also applies to Gabriel another 13-year-old wife has a different set of challenges he's actually quite remarkably gifted in mathematics he can multiply three numbers by three numbers in his head with yet when it comes to trying to have a conversation he has great difficulty he doesn't make eye contact he has difficulty starting a conversation feels awkward and when he gets nervous he actually shuts down yet both of these boys at the same diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder one of the things that concerns us is whether or not he really is an epidemic of autism these days 188 children will be diagnosed with autism and the question is has that number been increasing dramatically over time or is it because we have now started labeling individuals with autism simply giving them that diagnosis when they were still present there before the next question everyone wonders is what caused autism in fact only not one single answer just as autism is a spectrum there's a spectrum of etiologies spectrum of causes so the thing to know about Wendy Chinese that she never set out to crack autism she was a genetics researcher who sort of stumbled upon a realization I think the realization came to me here into several of us that genetics at least could be one of the factors in autism didn't necessarily mean that all children with autism had an underlying genetic cause but that it could be the genetic cause in theory was tested early in her career when she met a little girl named Mika in this particular case meet his parents came to mean many many years ago having done the best they could to try and understand what was going on with her daughter and why she wasn't developing the same as other children, and for example we get couldn't speak she clearly had significant disabilities including autism but not any one thing that looked particularly unique she looked like a beautiful healthy child otherwise she clearly had something going on with referring and on top of that she get seizures lots of them on a daily basis she didn't have any family history of a similar conditions out there wasn't anything for a second that it was something clearly running in the family and so when each on again to wonder what is the source of Nick's disability was a genetic mutation and what if you could identify that he is certain individuals they can actually have genetic changes or mutations that are not passed down from the mother or from the father and actually start brand-new in them mutations that are present in the a or this farm at the time of conception that had not been passed down generation to generation within the family the fact that the Simons foundation we took 2600 individuals that had no family history of autism and we took that child and their mother and father and use them to try and understand what were those genes to do that we actually had to comprehensively able to look at all that genetic information and determine what those differences were between the mother and father in the child in doing so so is when he goes on to explain every single human cell is made up of exactly 46 chromosomes and if any one piece of those 46 chromosomes that make up the billions of cells in our bodies is out of balance can have a huge effect on the way our brains function so in the case of the The girl who was diagnosed with autism is a toddler when he was able to map out her genetic information to try and figure out what caused her brain to unction in the lead I still remember when we did that the only reason we were able to find the cause is literally like looking for a needle in the haystack was because we saw one single letter out of 3 billion letters we saw one single letter for Nika that was different from her mom in different from her dad something we knew that wasn't inherited from either one of them and suddenly when we looked at that particular place that one letter that was different we saw that it affected this gene called snap 25 actually affecting all different areas beneath his brain as well as causing procedures you up to discover that one single genetic vacation and identify it and know that that's where it came from that's exactly right knowing that this was the problem meant that we could start the journey to trying to figure out how to fix it but an event journey that that process of trying to fix it could get him elected delegate I think their pieces on it were cracking every day in terms of understanding the complexities of the human mind I don't hunt will ever truly understand having geeky sort of think about what what you do as trying to crack code absolutely so the first thing that we identified for human disease took me eight years on the last gene that we identified for human disease took eight days it's really remarkable in terms of how quickly we can move forward on and I think it's that puzzle that I'm so obsessed with his enemies from the genetic point of you trying to crack that code about what those genes are and trying to put that into a massive new puzzle in terms of how those jeans fit together how this proteins that together how those neurons that together what the different parts of the brain do and why they're different in some individuals Kami given come home at night just think I never figure this out like of course my career in a never been I think you have the stark reality is for many of us we realize that there's only so much that we can do and industries like this really massively complex feeds you have to be able to break down and pieces I think I think the humbling part of this is that the mind is just wonderfully beautifully complex and we will start to understand parts of it so they're just amazing opportunities we have to study this likely didn't a generation ago cavities and still its were wonderfully complex human beings and appreciating all of that is awe-inspiring Lenny Chang is a genetic researcher and pediatrician you can find out more about her groundbreaking work and see her full-time Ted.com show 10 show talking about how curiosity leads to discovery and Adam you are Can you own inch dish itself all right my name is Adam Savage I'm currently cohost an executive user MythBusters on the Discovery Channel and I'm a lifelong maker of things and curious person to and his curiosity like running your family you know my dad was definitely a polymath he was a painter he was an animator filmmaker a wonderful writer but I'm trying to think if there was a moment I had no easy did make me race card I had this teddy bear named Gus I wanted a racecar for and my dad spent weeks out in his studio making this thing out of hardware cloth wire mesh evening hamster cage out of and fiberglass polyester fiber glass which I still consider one of the worst materials to work with and just the act of I am interested in a toy I can make that toy that's what he said to me by giving that to me even know how to do it he was just winging it and that was completely informative for me and like his dad Adams a major he's designed models and props for big films but you invest from the TV show MythBusters where he and his cohost Jamie Heinemann test out questions like if you drop a penny of the Empire State building would it kill someone we realized that the strongest episodes were the ones driven by the narrative of our curiosity you know that is the nature of science it's often that union of the discovery is not the end of a line of looking for something it's tangential to it because something happened even expect someone said that the phrase it typifies real discovery isn't Eureka but the that's funny okay and been an episode would like the outcome was not at all what you expected yet there is a really good example doesn't miss about a guy who got very drunk at a party and convinced a friend of his to drive him home) will accept the problem was his friend was legally blind but they got home because he gave his blind friend directions from the vaccine so Jamie and I actually got a real blind guy carries 100% blind and that means I was the seat of the car will be set back in a close course of course every turn our left but to really tell the story we needed to have a drunk person Janie got drunk for this theme has vetted vindaloo cinnamon and the most astonishing thing happened that we did not expect at all was that Jamie's direction and you and immediately made a blind guy drive like a drunk person while he is leaving a lot more around the road to think it will behind the cart was totally clear that there was a drunk person in charge of the club are the that's one of my all-time favorite results again soon nobody exactly won a prize for that experiment the plan is Adam checked out a weird idea any discovered something kind of interesting and nobody got hurt here's Adam on the Ted stage the findings about owning a brain is you have no control over the things that gathers and holds onto the facts and the stories and as you get older it only gets worse things stick around for years sometimes for you understand why you are interested in them before you understand their import to you what Richard Feynman was young boy in Queens he went for a walk with his dad and his wagon and all and noticeably pull the wagon the ball into the back of the Vatican and he asked his dad why does the ball back I can instead said that inertia he said once inertia is that inertia is the name that scientists give to the phenomenon of the ball going to the back of the wagon but in truth nobody really knows finally went on to earn degrees in MIT Princeton he saw the Challenger disaster and he ended up winning the Nobel Prize in six Feynman diagrams describing the movement of subatomic particles and he credits that conversation with his father is giving him a sense the simplest questions could carry you out to the edge of human knowledge and that's where he wanted to play playing it make a story and can you think the timing was pleasant.&nbsp; He didn't have his curiosity could he have gone to do what he did like it's almost like he had passes questions he had to be that kind of person yeah I mean he had the brain he had the brain totally wanted to exercise itself there's another story about Feynman of him cooking a spaghetti dinner with a friend and his friend is is breaking the spaghetti to put it in the pot he notices that the strands of a dry spaghetti don't just break cleanly and have to do is often a third piece that springs out between the other two And from a material science standpoint that is a strange behavior and as the story goes they never got to eating they ended up breaking every piece of pasta they could find in the house to try and figure out why the molecular structure of postulated to do this weird thing where it broke a third piece of this is what really gets me going about science whenever I'm having trouble understanding the concept I go back to research the people to discover that concept is the story of how they came to understand what happens when you look at what the discoverers were thinking about when they made their discoveries you understand that they are not so different from us we are all back to me and wanted we all start with the same tools love the idea that different branches of science are called fields of study most people think of sizes of close blackbox and in fact it is an open field keep legacy see the process of discovery in his second journey rather than a place easy get you to figure it out oh that's 110% that there is no and there is no point at which you think well of him.and there is the chasing the moment of of of interest in turning it into a moment of understanding however small and irate at this time, was a mazelike when you talk to a child right to full questions about just the universe about everything around them about why why cars move and how they move out total worksite and all these questions that into simpler analyzing the beginner not answered we just accept that there an answer questions we</p>
<p style="margin: 0px; font-size: 16px; font-family: Times;">would like soda and defeat on the part of us adults don't think yes and and I I was very lucky that in high school and to science teachers that were really influential one was my freshman earth science teacher who he would say things in class that would rock my world and I was a lonely kid in the much to do it live so I go back to his classroom which is right across the hall from the lunch room and I would sit there and just asking questions and this is I like to say this is so long ago he was sitting there in an off.&nbsp; Grading papers and smoking in the classroom but he would send it answer questions and then you know any line of questioning leads to the ultimate Iona dear because we don't know the most fundamental part that everything or sometimes when you do if the answer in your five-year-old says that's not true you disable if you if you don't need streets FFF FFF the Advil at this teacher would sit there and when I got to the end of a line of questioning he'd say I have no idea I don't know why the flame I don't know why candle flame goes pop when you flick it with your finger here and for a teacher to say that to a kid is really important it's it's actually critical for kids to learn that the people in authority don't know everything in fact really don't know anything will hear all explores people to meet discoveries just thought a little bit harder about what they were looking at and they were a little bit more curious and your curiosity changed the way people thought about the world and thus did change the world facing the world and so can you thank you him and and Savage is the cohost of the show MythBusters check out his two talks Ted that NPR.org okay and in case you are wondering what guys happen if you drop a penny of the Empire State building 325 all that is next to her show today from curiosity to discovery how it begins how we keep it alive in ourselves stay with this guy rise and this is the radio hour from NPR it's the Ted radio hour from NPR I'm die rise and on the show today from curiosity to discovery stories about the source of curiosity and how it drives the things we do so what will drive your curiosity I think for me what I became just in a addicted to early on was finding new things and it sort of and in a very sort of basic way it's a little bit like your singing nature or science is this amazing thing Reagan basically ask questions of nature and nature will provide some sort of answer to and there's something so incredible about being able to do that this is Nathan Wolfe he's a microbiologist and something of an Explorer the reality is there so much unexplored that's all around us if we think about life in a slightly different way any sense to make those new discoveries we don't have to look too far here's Nathan Wolfe on the Ted stage recently I visited Beloit Wisconsin and I was there to honor a great 20th century explorer Roy Chapman Andrews during his time at the American Museum of Natural History and is let a range of expeditions to uncharted regions like here in the Gobi desert he was quite a figure he was later said the basis of the Indiana Jones character and when I was in the late Wisconsin I gave a public lecture to group of middle school students and I'm here to tell you if there's anything more intimidating than talking here it had will be trying to hold the attention of a group of the thousand 12-year-olds from 45 minute lecture don't try that one at the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions but there was one that's really stuck with me since then there was a young girl who stood up and she asked the question where should we explore I think there's a sense that many of us have the great age of exploration on earth is over the for the next generation of it have to go to outer space of the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore but is that really the case is the really know where significant process Explorer (or of course there is and the next frontier microbes and it sounds a little strange and out but is actually so little we know about microbes even the ones in our very own bodies you really just were to think about the diversity of microbes that are on your hand or on the outside of your coffee cup there's likely to be unexplored unknown diversity just sitting right there in that environment and so I think one of the things that excites me as a scientist about that world is sort of how much is left to discover you can experience like 6 billion Moon landings every day just to copy company that's exactly right yet we now know the viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet more than the genetic information all other forms of life combined and obviously there's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world things like the eradication of smallpox the advance of the vaccine against cervical cancer which we now know is mostly caused by human papilloma virus we have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world things like deep sequencing which allow us to do much more than just sort of skimmed the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species to look entire meta-genomes the communities of teaming microorganisms in on around us and to document all of the genetic information these we can apply these techniques to things from soil to scan and everything in between were just the very beginning of understanding this this whole new world of microbes absolutely this is one of the most exciting things about being a microbiologist right now is that the tools that we have for exploration River sort of the equivalent of telescopes and GPS systems we have for navigating this unseen worlds I have exploded really even over the last 5 to 10 years we could take a specimen like let's say we were to take a swab from your nose for example the first thing that we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information and if we started looking into that genetic information we see a number of usual suspects out there of course a lot of human genetic information but also bacterial and viral information mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose we also see something very very surprising as we started to look at this information we would see that about 20% of genetic information in your nose doesn't match anything that we've ever seen before new plant animal fungus virus or bacteria basically we have no clue what this is and for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter we know it's not anything that we've seen before it's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information and is a lot of that if you think 20% of genetic information your noses a lot biological dark matter for you look to your got up to 40 or 50% of that information is biological dark matter and even in the relatively sterile blood around 1 to 2% of this information is dark matter can't be classified campy type to match with anything we've seen before you have this write your segment that with in our own DNA there these tiny bits of genetic information that the no scientist has ever been able to identify what they don't know what it is and that's that's crazy yes and in your people think about the data revolutionary was very interested in how much data is out there and how much data to cabinet seems a tremendous amount while totally right now that most of the information content of our planet is locked up in microbes in the DNA and RNA of microorganisms and only just starting to uncover what that means at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact rabies deep sequencing tools are relatively new but as they become more and more accurately determined that this information is a form of life release some of it is a form of life and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter really only in their infancy there's a very very exciting possibility that exists it buried in this life are signatures in this genetic information or signatures but as of yet unidentified life the perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of the cancer that afflicts us identify the source of an outbreak and we aren't familiar with and perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology a little over 100 years ago people were unaware of viruses forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet hundred years from now people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life the literally was right under our noses there was a time not very long ago when discovery of unknown organisms was something that told incredible offer us it had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves I thought about ourselves many people I think on our planet right now despair and they think we've reached the point where we discovered most of the things in Italy right now please don't despair this is honestly the most exciting.&nbsp; Ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet the dominant things that exist here we know almost nothing about and yet finally we have the tools which allow us to actually explore that world and understand them thank you very much faith in Wolf the Zen microbiologist to also looks for the source viruses is amazing to his head that NPR.org earlier in the show we heard from James Cameron's gave a 10 talk all about curiosity explain how in the opening scenes of his film Titanic used small robots to explore the ship's wreckage the robots were hunting for treasure but for James Cameron the footage he was shooting was the real treasure he filmed in himself to and half miles below the surface of the Atlantic Ocean and you know it took a lot of preparation we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things but it struck me how much this dive these deep dives was like a like a space mission nowhere was it was highly technical and required enormous planning and you get in this Godowns the Dark Hostile Environment Where There's No Hope of Rescue If You Can't Get Back by Yourself And You Know I I Thought Wow I'm Unlike Living in a Science Fiction Movie This Is Really Cool And so I I Really Got Bitten by the Bug of Deep Ocean Exploration Of Course the Curiosity of Size Component of It It Was Everything It Was Adventure It Was Curiosity Was Imagination It Was an Experience That Hollywood Couldn't Give Me the Steel I Can Imagine Creaturely Create a Visual Effect for Bike Couldn't Imagine What I Was Seeing Out That Window As We Did Some of Our Subsequent Expeditions I Was Seeing Creatures of Hydrothermal Vents and and Sometimes Things like Had Had Never Seen before Sometimes Things That No One Had Seen before the Next You Are Not Described by Science at the Time We Saw Them An Image the So I Was Completely Smitten by This Then Had to Do More And so I Actually Made a Country's Decision after the Success of Titanic I Said Okay on the Park My Day Job As a Hollywood Moviemaker, Go Be a Full-Time Explorer from the A While Has Now Been Almost 2 Decades And during That Time Teens Cameron Has Made More Than a Dozen
