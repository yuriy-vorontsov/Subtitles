This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars cities like living things evolve slowly overtime buildings and structures get added and renovated and removed and in this process there are bits and pieces I get left behind little vestiges humans have tell them that no tales Wales have pelvic bones but no legs and cities has stairs that lead to nowhere telephone poles without wiring tonight I carry nothing at all that's pretty certain leverage of most of the time these architectural leftovers rest are crumbling at taking down the other times these messages are not an may remain in the urban organism and sometimes even though they no longer serve any discernible purpose whatsoever they are actually maintaining they cleaned and polished and repaired and repeated just because they these architectural leftovers first caught the attention of an artist in Japan name a Casa Galligan to this is a 1972 one day he was on his lunch break with some friends and as they were walking to lunch sticking across the staircase that went up and then back down but there was no door at the top visit just walked up and walked back down and there was a piece of the railing that had been recently fixed something clicked in my son at that is not hard to he's translated in passing I was working to English because ago himself doesn't speak English and he's up there in years and he's not currently doing the interviews that his passion for the city vestiges spread to my farm very rare for one there's not a lot of facets of our life these days that are allowed to be completely Acosta Gallus all these urban leftovers as artistic byproducts of the city the photograph all the things you can find or both the schedule and maintain he began publishing his findings in a magazine, accompanied by musings about each object so for example this is what a Casa Galli wrote that the stairs to no way everything in a capitalist society has to have a purpose so where does that leave this particular staircase could you call it a staircase when all it did was let you keep into a window of course you can't you can only call it art the work of art shaped like a staircase people began defending as the Gallup pictures of similar architectural leftovers that they and it is Colin Acosta Gallo would evaluate their submissions on two criteria one with a truly completely useless Q had they been recently maintained in 1985 because the Gallup published a book of these collected photographs and writings which Matt Fargo translated into English for the first time in 2009 and of course now Matt finds these things everywhere and then change the way he sees his surroundings architectures causally changing being amended that is fun to think about how to wind up where we are now and have the warp and woof of how it formed over years not a static thing the changing nature of the city was especially clear to Gaza Gala as a Japanese artist Japan's rapid reorganization after World War II created a lot of the city vestiges as a gala coined a term for these kinds of urban leftovers those that are again but totally purposeless and regularly maintained he called then Thomas and it comes from Gary Thomasson who is a baseball player American baseball player and that a really good one Gary Thomas and played for the LA Dodgers the New York Yankees in the San Francisco Giants that step by another also called the Giants the Yomiuri Giants which is like the Yankees of Japan have all the money in the they would allow the title also incidentally Cialis spirit resulting located in Tokyo they hired him to come over and it made him an exorbitant amount of money the decedent's new country on this team the great slugger Gary Thompson lost his strong you got there and could not hit the Japanese pitcher 11 the actually set the all-time strikeout record in Japan in 1981 he remained in this racks until his contract ran out the following year so you basicallyâ€¦ Sitting on the bench in collecting a lot of money Ms. after Miss Gary Thomas and gain the nickname the human fan you know for swinging the bat around only moving the air and so that's kind of useless player that was being physically maintains was a cussing olive oil for for these objects he was finding after not translated across the guy was original book which by the way is entitled HyperCard Thompson the American publishers want to get a conversation going stateside they collaborated with a team of artists and photographers to find Thomason's all around San Francisco which is where the publisher was based at the time it was our liaison project it was partly to come about in the idea clear light spearheaded this project in CA collaborator Alan Manolo took this on their own Thomas and you find them all of the city my show them to you you will go down for all the Thomas and that Claire and Allen founded San Francisco their favorite ones six politically on a drawbridge right in front of 18 to home of the world champion Savitz owns a big Giants fan and outside the stadium on the drawbridge and after former dry in the feudal beyond a Plaza after former giant maze he found some objects unofficially named after former giant Gary Thompson is to one of one on each side it is like the credit robot sent regards that exhibits is a drawbridge and either side and lifting arm gates now like the barriers that lower at railroad crossings to the cars are moving forward next in these modern lifting iron gates I the old models or what's left of their arms were chopped off at the base is still there and this old useless days is still maintained a attributable to move the campaign but they didn't remove it and they had it painted before so we cannot figure out why it's still there elected the single is the bridge black this kind of industrial black Indies Thompson's was in the only indisputable examples that Claire and Ellen found airplane things in the city that are just down it's the maintenance true Thomas and Karen Allen Gillis to a loading dock by the San Francisco Marina pointed out a staircase that led to know way a classic Thomas or so it seemed upon closer look we weren't so certain I don't want to, I don't think it has been repainted because if you look at the bottom and if the states into into the breast brotherly railings of Adderall needed and rested so that is the second posted in the boilers huddled around the railing and tried to figure out if the rest was handed over which would mean that it was a Thompson or the paint was arrested over which would make it not a Thomas and it looks like it's freshly painted but then were figuring it was in and that it just hasn't been use of so that's why doesn't it like it is Mixer cuts on it this discourse is part of the fun of Thompson's anyone who does look at broken down to the parts that takes active examination and attention to assess in this object is truly useless and has been cared for this detailed book and made 20 To go was encouraging his writings and publications and so we imitate that without website Claire teamed up with Matt Fargo the translator to create a blog where people can offer at their own potential, so for analysis and debate and that's if you were actually using and sending in there that comes in smaller like in Acosta goes original magazine, there are submissions in his commentary is whether or not they met the definition of a Thomas the yellow the beautiful pictures at stray litter Matt Fargo again and then one day they got a submission that was definitely not a Thomason or maybe it was the truest Thomasson of them all one day we got one that was just the big picture of a middle finger and it said thank you for making my family forever famous something like that it was from Gary Thomas daughter that middle finger was a pretty clear sign the Thomason family is not leave if indeed that is actually dead, since Diane submitted they delay the family declined to comment for this story which brings us to another debate the on whether or not something is Thomas is it fair to call these things, since at all Gary Tomasson was a remarkable baseball player for a long time it just be a professional baseball player in of itself is amazing hitting a baseball going 90 mph is about the hardest thing to do in professional sports if you are astigmatic fail 70% of the time combine that with Thompson getting on in years the stress of living abroad and any number of other things that could've been going on in his life and the time totally understandable that he was splendor that he was for the San Francisco Giants and the Galilee that he followed is a fan of the Yomiuri Giants you stand of Gary Thomas and it was because I goes big fear knowingly totally wanted to publish the book is like I don't know about in a publishing a English because it might be very embarrassing for the Thompson family and no one heard anything he's a sweet man Matt himself was pretty nervous about the Thomason family's reaction I can imagine what he would say SOP knows that nothing but love for him and that that because I was really really nervous about that but not so nervous because ago wouldn't publish the book and unfortunately the name Thomasson works well thanks it's catchy and maybe it's kind me in fact refers are about Thompson's was really me then I try to remember all the baseball players I could from the 1970s and I came up with something like for names and now because the Casa Gala Gary Thompson has transcended even Pete Rose and Reggie Jackson and join the immortal ranks of the abdomen card again leotard the sandwich silhouette and since on however hurtful but useless title might be the legacy of the Casa Gallus Thompson one could argue is ultimately a positive common sense are delightful defined they inspired artists translators performers and urban explorers around the world Thomason's art treasures waiting to be discovered and in plus if you need to get a gift for the urban design enthusiast who has everything I'm thinking I'm Gary Thompson baseball card the perfect 99% invisible was Bruce's week by a brief truffle men with
