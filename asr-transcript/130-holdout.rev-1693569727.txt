In 1914 in Manhattan the city government 
Took ownership of an apartment building belonging to a guy 
Named David Hess the use of legal power: eminent domain which allows governments to seize private property for public use in this case they want to expand subway system has fought and lost it was all said and done his building was torn down and he was left with a triangle shaped piece of property and when his triangle shaped means the property has refreshed with pleasant out the size and shape of the very large slice of he was not and is that's her producer Katie mingle later in the city tried to get him to donate his efficient property so they can build sidewalk he received again they don't decide like anyway in the middle of the sidewalk is half his triangle with the tile mosaic every property and the Hesse state which has never been dedicated for public purposes in other words get off my triangle jerks it's still there by the way on the corner of Christopher Street and seventh Avenue and West Village people like David Hess who refuse to sell their properties are called and any domain only comes into play when the government wants your property for public use if it's a private development once your place and you refuse to sell there's not much they can do although there have been cases where eminent domain has been controversially used for private development but that's another story in China and a contract holdout houses nail this email seems that the pictures of single houses sticking up like the head of the nail everything else around them bulldozed and carved out basically anywhere there's a lot of new development there are bound to be developers who have plans to make lots and lots of money if they can just get that one stubborn person to move which brings us to one of the most stubborn and steadfast holdouts ever Edith Masefield the FIFA always call her Mrs. Mason checking the lady she's one of the only reporters who ever got an interview with Mrs. Mayfield after she achieved to unwavering persistence good manners and proper attire during development and making decided to me today I think that I like your skirt Edith Mayfield lived in Seattle neighborhoods called in Ballard had once been its own little town until was annexed into Seattle in 1907 to have the feel of a small a lot of single-family homes and small businesses that started to change around 2005 when development of really started to sprout or condominiums we started hearing some pushback from full-time residents in the neighborhood felt the neighborhood was changing to quickly Ballard became so iconic of this type of superfast high-density development that when it happens in other neighborhoods we collect that LA guys station of my neighborhood so in 2005 when Ballard was in the middle of being Ballard authorized a developer wanted to build a shopping center that would take up the entire block were Edith Masefield have lived for the last 50 years is a sale task lists in a more industrial section of Ballard and her block was mostly empty besides her tiny house just you can picture house you know you're kidding you draw a picture of the house is a little square with a triangle on top then he put a little front door and a couple of windows on each side that is exactly what Edith Masefield's house look like the developers offered her $750,000 for her house which was appraised at about 120,000 and I think probably she said no and solicit no problem will just build our model around you like literally all around you Diane Barry Martin I working construction is a project superintendent so I'm just a guy out there in the site making sure that you it all gets done Barry was hired to oversee the shopping center project and he that some Valley residents weren't happy about all the new development that he wasn't too worried I mean it just a job for me
and really think about it you really one way or another he hadn't yet heard about he has made field Sony got closer to where was to start the project my wife asked me if that was the one where there was a little lady Delmon Beland would move I said no legs that it is you is scheduled told me I called him up in the said old yet did we tell you him and Weber said you can't stand in the way of progress this never tried to step over Edith Macy Ballard woman refuse to sell her little house to developers the little old lady being bullied by developer the story was classic David and Goliath Edith Masefield versus the big bad developers and super excited about all the extra media attention on his project I'm thinking this is a lose lose proposition because all she has to do is you don't complain and knew until somebody in the TV station or the on the newspaper you will be a pretty big deal that even the past less clamoring to talk to Mrs. Maceo she wanted nothing to do with talking them The lady had been when the few exceptions as this is a field turning out help from the CBS reporter as she took out the trash in her front yard does however well he's me she like to be addressed as Mrs. Masefield thank you very much later in segment he knocks her door and you can hear muffled go away unfortunately that muscled recording of a cranky Mrs. Mayfield is the only one we kind of her she passed away in 2008 each will talk about more later from my second day there were what invite you to his house and she was on the front yard with her flowers in her little dog that was blind the worker started to demolished a few other buildings that were on the block and dig up a bunch of soil contaminated with lead and all allowed a neighbor Mrs. Mayfield went about her business day after day just like she'd always done should get up in the morning and feed the birds and throw emergency on the sidewalk most the time the birds he would be here we got to work and if the birdseed wasn't there by 10 o'clock we knew something wasn't right if they didn't see the Bernstein IRA would not door to see if she was okay and she would usually elected or get the hell out of there and go away and leave her alone can I just go CHECK on you a lot of people thought that construction started in earnest live Mayfield would fold the noise and encouragement on privacy would just be too much the architect even design the building in such a way that if Mrs. Masefield ever decided to move they can easily incorporate the space warehouse was into the building that she didn't follow the developers out there offered to $1 million plus they offer designers similar homes my house and pay for a home healthcare worker she turned them down year passed in the building around he is Ms. Fieldhouse got bigger and bigger the image of it was really something you may have seen pictures of the house especially if you're from Seattle the building coward 40 feet above her in her little house was was dwarfed fairly well it wasn't just a big building sitting next to a tiny house it was a big building completely enveloping a tiny house on three sides the walls of the building were so close that Mrs. Masefield could practically leaning out her window and watch the as the building live fire in the construction workers Checking in on Mrs. Mayfield and occasionally bring her lunch from McDonald's purportedly loved big and tasty and very kept dropping off business card telling her to call if she needed any and then one day she finally did said that she didn't feel comfortable driving that day and could I give her right Gerhard no better in the car and started driving over there we're kind of talking about how he'll bow it was changing and sort of surprisingly Edith Mayfield wasn't angry about the May ballot was changing she wasn't even angry about the modular building more or less on top of her house she said because it always changes to 20 years from now the return this down and building something else she do that just the way goes I felt like she was happy that we were there he didn't mind the noises I was through World War II in the lady at and that she didn't mind the attention from the essay construction workers who walked by her hot friend I'll waste to her heart smiled and kept in a little bit she'd been there for 50 years that point in time you know she was 86 years old money didn't really mean much to her anymore she couldn't move around very well she knew everything was in her house she had no reason to move she didn't have any family so get the money so that she can leave it for family didn't exist Mrs. Mayfield didn't have any living family delete any money to by the same token she didn't have any family to help take care of her in her old age pasting day started taking her to all of her appointments many started making them and then he got concerned that Mrs. Mayfield who is getting more frail by the day was going to burn herself on her stove so I started swing by there after work and make our dinner and get a microwave so I guess I have to cook forces will have to worry about anymore pretty seen Barry was making her lunch and breakfast as well one day I woke up in the making or three meals a day and I had come in on Saturday and Sunday because you know I had to make meals spending all this time together he gets numbness is in a sealed pretty well they listen to music together lots old movies and Mrs. Mayfield also had crazy story about her past she told me that she was a spy for the British government that she had been captured spine and the current account then she escaped from there she also had she taken care of the bunch of war orphans in England after World War II and top of all of that she claimed to know a bunch of famous people usually Benny Goodman was her cousin and it should admit to Tommy Jimmy Dorsey Natalie the real saxophone and clarinet with her stories were so incredible that they were hard for people to believe but they were hiding to dismiss than you might think seeking custody has very sharp she like to talk a lot about the past that she also the news and knew exactly what was going on dates attended Mrs. Mayfield for nearly a year making out for meals visiting with her on weekends and after work sometimes she call in the middle of the night and timesheet had an accident and she needed you know she had very few wishes one she wanted to die in her house you live our last days in her house but if I wouldn't been there at some point in time they would've put her in a state run facility and there was any reason for that an instrument be unhappy the last days of her life all men for what when she was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and began to die she finally agreed to a home healthcare worker that Barry became her power as attorney the person she put in charge of her final decisions Edith Masefield died in her house on June 15, 2008 she was 86 years old she left her house to Barry Martin the construction superintendent who became her friend all simultaneously sandwiching her house between a Trader Joe's in LA fitness after she died a began packing up her house and he looks at things that would confirm this is Mayfield's crazy stories about her past he never found anything about her escaping Cowart carrying for any more they did find Benny Goodman record written inscription that said to my cousin needed with love and after people send at the Edith Mayfield had left her house to Barry Martin there were some cotton opportunities ultimately it's hard for anyone other than buried to know what his motivations where that for what it's worth I did talk to a couple of the home healthcare workers who took care of Mrs. Mayfield before she died and they both had a very high opinion and sent said he was there every day when no one else was in that he seemed to care deeply for Mrs. Mayfield very eventually sold Edith Masefield's house to an investor who had various plans were none of which have materialized and recently the same guy asked Mary if you'd be interested in buying it back he said knowing a fight did Edith would probably probably haunt me for that she told me to hold out until I got my price and then to you know use the money to help get my kids through school the house is all boarded up now and no one's sure what will happen to it which is sad to some people the Barry says Mrs. Mayfield didn't care what happened to the house after she died but she never really cared about the bigger story that the outside world he created a pattern she had her own personal reasons for staying in her house and they had nothing to do with that narrative but whatever her reasons were for doing she stood her ground into became a symbol whether she wanted to or not there's even a tattoo shop in Seattle that is a special tattoo in honor of the legacy of Edith Masefield it's a picture of her little house in underneath it the word steadfast nine &
