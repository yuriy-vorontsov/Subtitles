This is 99% Invisible. 

I'm Roman Mars. 

In 2005 I took a job at WBEZ in Chicago, and I was so excited to be moving there. 

I was excited about the job, of course, but I was also very excited about the grid. 

The streets of Chicago and the address numbering system are beautiful. 

Starting from the 00 axis point downtown, the streets conform to a rigid grid pattern where the major streets are exactly 1 mile apart, and have address numbers which are in multiples of 800. 

You don't really have to be able to picture this, but I know that if you know it, you're nodding your head vigorously. 

But just know that it's amazing, and I was mesmerized by it. 

So much so that I made flashcards with Chicago street names on one side, and the corresponding address number on the other so that my wife and I could quiz ourselves on the 2000 mile road trip from San Francisco to Chicago. 

Yes, I was always like this.

Division is 1200 N. Armitage is 2000 N., and therefore one mile north of Division. 

After living in the jumble of San Francisco streets for years, the thought of moving to a place where people planned the city to help people know where they were, and where they were going, soothed my lizard brain and gave me peace. 

As humans have developed cities and built environments, we have also needed to develop ways to find our way through them. Signage goes back at least as far as the Roman Empire. They constructed milestones along the roadways. 

Which is to say, if you rely on anything besides natural features to help you find your way around, you are relying on things made by people whose job it is to help us figure out how to get from all of our respective point As to our point Bs. 

Our producer Sam Greenspan would like to tell you that he has a fantastic sense of direction.

I really do! 

Sure, I get lost sometimes, I admit it. 

It's the worst. 

I get mad at myself when it happens, but now my life is completely different ever since asserted thinking about what it means that wayfinding is a thing. 

Wayfinding, in a sense, is a branch of environmental graphic design concerned with helping people find their way. 

I love knowing this, because now I get lost in hospital or a complicated freeway interchange or an airport, I have someone to blame.

That's one way to look at it, but a lot of times it has nothing to do with the signage. 

User error does apply sometimes. 

Fair enough. 

Let me introduce you to Jim Harding. 

Well, my name is Jim Harding. 

I'm an environmental graphic designer. 

Basically, I tell people where to go.

There's an environmental graphic designer or wayfinder, or maybe just a kid with a magic marker, behind every sign. 

Turn here to merge onto the 101. 

Concourse E is this way. 

Bathrooms straight ahead.

But there is a lot, lot more to wayfinding than just signage. what mortally fighting than just signage. 

Signage is probably least effective tool of wayfinding. 

Good architecture is one of the best. 

It's not that Jim hate signs. 

Rather, the best forms of wayfinding are - shall we say - invisible. 

They're baked into the built environment.

I first heard about Jim Harding through a writer named David Zweig.

I'm David Zweig, I'm a writer. 

My book is called "Invisibles: The Power of Anonymous Work in an Age of Relentless Self-Promotion."

David Zweig's book is a series of portraits of people whom he refers to as "invisibles."

Invisibles are people who are highly skilled professionals, people who are really important to whatever enterprise or endeavor that they are part of, that their work really has a big effect on the overall outcome, yet who are largely unknown, never thought of by the public or the end-user.

Jim Harding, Director of Environmental Graphics for Reggression Smith and Partners is one such invisible.

Jim Harding is one of the best in the business.

Jim worked on the new international terminal at Hartsfield Jackson international Airport in Atlanta, Georgia - the world's busiest, 100 million passengers move through it every year, all of them needing to know where to go. 

Site lines are so important, because if you can see your destination, you don't have to rely on signage. 

I met Jim at the Atlanta airport, and he walked me through some of the cutting edge wayfinding techniques that he employed at the new international terminal.

Like right when you walk in from curbside, the physical space tells you everything you need to know about how to move through it, without you even realizing it. 

Let's start at the first thing you want when you enter the airport, the ticket counter.

They're not lined up on on a 90° axis; they're angled, okay.

A lot of times, the ticket counter just meets you head on when you walk in, and then you're left to wonder, "Okay do I go left or right, where's the sign for my gate." 

These angled ticket counters subtly push you in the right direction.

The angle steers you down and around the ticket counter and heading toward the security checkpoint. 

As the counters pushing you, you're also getting pulled by this giant three-story glass window that looks out onto the tarmac.

You see planes, you see the apron, the jetway where the planes are parking, and so intuitively you're drawn to your plane, cause that's where you want to go, you want to get on that plane, right?

And there are less obvious cues, too, like the tile pattern in the floor. 

Absolutely, you see the grid?

Instead of being on a 90° axis its on a 45.

And these tiles going off at a 45° angle, they just beckon you to follow them.

So if you do that, you inevitably head toward security.

But there's even more going on in the floor than that.

And here's where this gets a little bananas.

Turnaround and look back here, Sam.

You see where the black starts at the door there curbside?

There's another set of tiles inside the dominant grid pattern that I didn't even notice at first.

It starts black, and then it's joined by a set of yellow goldish tiles that kind of cleans out this corridor of negative space, which cuts straight through the hall going directly to security.

See, yeah if I already have my ticket and I'm not checking any bags, and I don't need to check in at the counter, I just follow the yellow brick road, so to speak. 

That's amazing! 

That's exactly what it is, it's the yellow brick road; that's exactly what this is. 

A little lightbulb, it's clicking on, yeah?

It's pretty cool. 

And all of this, Jim says, is 100% intentional.

Absolutely, our interior designers went through a the number floor pattern design schemes until we arrived at this one.

On the other side of security, we enter what Jim Harding calls the transition hall.

Here's where a traveler has some decisions to make - whether to find a gate here, or whether to go to the Concourse - you have to take a subway called the plane train for that - or whether to head to baggage claim.

This is the part where passengers are going to be asking themselves, "Where am I? Where am I going?  How do I know the best way to get there?"

Jim says that in these places where there are decisions to be made, this is where wayfinding is needed the most.

You have the visual wayfinding, which is the signage - you can see it, you can interpret it, you can find your way around. 

There's also information desk and that newfangled interactive displa.

I walk with Jim towards the gates. 

Here's F7... F9... so it looks like the odds on the left.

Very good! Alright, you're into the wayfinding!

This concourse is pretty streamlined - elegant even - but at older, less well-designed concourses which are definitely present some other parts of the ATL airport, this is where you'd find yourself in a visual Marasse. 

You've seen this before. 

Neon signs and brightly colored displays all trying to get you to buy magazines or neck pillows or hot dogs.

You have advertising, you have concessions, marketing... all of those visual messages compete with the primary message of just how to navigate the airport.

And so the key here is to make the signage stand out by being dull and drab and plain.

It's very neutral - neutral palette,  gray and white basically.

You can spot the signs just by tuning out all the glitz.


Now even though this new international terminal is fairly minimal, there are still people trying to sell you stuff.

Just beyond the transition hall towards the gates, there's this two level commerce area.

There's shopping at ground level, and then up an escalator are some food options.

And of course it's all angled perfectly so you have a direct line of sight into all the shops as you're walking by.

Is that intentional design to have the shopping down below and the the food up above?

Yes was the well more curb appeal for your retail tenants of people if they're hungry the rug 05 food wherever it is right like airports in a struggle to generate revenue if you and so anything they could do to help increase non-aeronautical revenue things that are not generated by plane or airline so improving their concessions and retail and they get a percentage of all the sales and that's when I realize why there are people like Jim Harding who are paid to do this work it's not just the airports want us to have a pleasant experience is because his money on the table think about it they are trying to connecting flight you don't a lot of time do we know you're going up stressed and I don't think I won't catch my flight will take time over my wallet had no with cool call collect enough, gay unaware of go on a more likely to stop the file whatever so now that's were wayfinding has a real a financial impact note to airport bottom Enzo turns out wayfinding isn't just about helping you figure out how to get there you want to go it's about steering the masses anywhere that companies hiring the way finders want the masses to be steered and what's more if your consumer choices aren't and make money for the powers that be inside of a closed system like an airport don't plan on the making it easy for you David Zweig the writer who introduced me to Jim Harding he noticed this kind of thing to their job isn't always about creating the best system for us the traveler sometimes it's who's paying the bills when I flew to Florida with my family we flew into Fort Lauderdale and we foolishly chose an off-site car-rental company of rookies yet big mistake we thought I'd toss I think you take us out of our superior two minutes about what happened is you arrive there there is huge signs for her to eat all the companies who are there if you're trying to find the off-site car-rental companies good luck if you try doing that with two little kids until David mentioned this to Jim Harding message and this seems like a wayfinding failure he said well the airport is far more interested in helping out the people who are paying them who have on-site facilities that have no incentive to have you read the airport go to someone else generate no revenue yet so there you most like second-class citizen yeah that's not to say though that is necessarily a dichotomy between capitalism and good user experience why we do we do for living is why fathers think it is to help out a little way to improve the overall quality of life that make customer experience passenger experience as a worker project like international terminal hinterland what we were going for years and after all a time's bill to walk through it you see like raw today you see people use the space understanding the space they are stressed or freaking out about this and apply is okay while not all works we did a good job and he does come with a nice of satisfaction I in theory when funding should work with your literate in it or not learning to see the subtle wayfinding cues in the landscape can help you understand how you make your decisions or it can make you question if you are the one even making your own decisions that all after I parted ways with Jim Harding I passed a food court and I noticed right outside in the floor were these big black curvy tiles and actually seem to be steering people towards the concessions they know next time you find yourself at an airport food court eating a Cinnabon that you didn't even want to check out the signage the shape of the tiling the height of the ceiling the quality of the light it may just be that you have an environmental graphic designer to blame the enough user error does imply 99% invisible was producers week by Sam Greenspan with Katie mingle Avery truffle and in the Roman Mars we are project 91.7 local public radio K ALW in San Francisco introduced of the offices of our
