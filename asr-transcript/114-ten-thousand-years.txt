This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars start with the letter and this is reporter Matthew Kelty's letter they sent out to a couple hundred people back in 1990 so I believe you had letter yesterday dear so-and-so the safe disposal of nuclear waste is one of the most pressing issues facing the United States today it totally is actually energy skip down to is that there is any that's just about how there's people were planning on Barry punches nuclear waste out in the New Mexico desert at this place called the waste isolation and economic and paragraph you have been nominated to participate in a study sponsored by Sandia national laboratories that would identify what kinds of markers should be placed after the WIPP site it just jumped and looked further to develop a marker system that will remain operational during the performance.  Of the site 10,000 years that is dated that is the part that I love I do moment wondering if it was a joke this John lumbered received one of these letters which makes sense given us one of what I'm an artist and I work on projects involving unusual communication give spent time in the 70s working with Carl Sagan and injuring on the political one of NASA's attempts at communicating with you see this sort of thing would be writings we'll know usually don't get asked to design something that will last 10,000 years that's twice the Spano recorded human history the federal government he was calling on him to help protect people 10,000 years in the future the waste isolation pilot Plant WIPP or with for short was ordered into existence by Congress in 1979 the thinking was the US ought to have a safe place to put radioactive byproducts from nuclear weapons manufacturing and nuclear power plant and a quick refresher even though you don't see radiation and you might not feel its effects right away exposure to radioactive materials can destroy your body at a molecular level it can leave burns can cause cancer it can even mutate your DNS the thing about radioactivity is that it is very spreadable say you've got a tool that touched a peaceable Tony now that tool is radioactive and say a worker was wearing protective gloves while using a tool chances are those gloves a radioactive to the waste isolation pilot Plant was designed to store all the stuff and keep us all safe from the website is in New Mexico deep in the desert about 26 miles east of Carlsbad this is a really cool place it reminded me of kind of the headquarters of Specter or Dr. no James Bond Charlotte existed to be underground facility filled with young technicians and in coveralls with all color-coded depending on what they did Johnson the website in person when he accepted the invitation from Sandia labs don't be part of the big thing & 10000 Year Morning Pl. turns out this was in 1991 so the work is to John into an elevator shaft and the go down about half a mile in the circuit and that's where John Saudis enormous caverns they've carved out this repository and basically assault deposit salt deposit 200 million years old and we think of salt as white but this salt for reasons I don't understand was kind of us, need pink Howard so the walls of this place were all crystalline with this search shot through with the use of love Sandman pink and orange so is actually quite beautiful all this media stuff will all be loaded in the thousands of oil drums into these cabins and then this underground chamber be sealed up unless the use will pass in those years will become decades and those decades will become centuries centuries will role in the millennia people above ground will come and go cultures will rise and fall in all the while below the surface cell will do what salt does the right temperature and pressure will slowly creep making a cave full of waist smaller and smaller smaller until the salt swallows up all those oil drums crushing to meet so they are solidified in the Earth's crust beneath club in the pool in the little bits from pond all still radioactive poison more than 200,000 years basically forever storing something dangerous is safely forever is a huge design problem in fact the jury still out on whether they sell the basics of the storage problem at all in February 2014 the leak was detected that expose several workers to low levels of radiation and with has been closed since the Department of Energy now predicts that it could be up to three years before whip is fully operational again we know these facts because we can look it up and read the news in a shared language but from that John Blomberg was brought out to New Mexico to solve was not about communicating the danger of whip to people today he wanted to figure out how to tell people millennia from now that this place is dangerous when John Mummert arrived in New Mexico he met the teammates he be collaborating with their work geologist linguists astrophysicists there was science fiction writer Gregory Benford.  The archaeologist this is Maureen Maureen An archaeologist with the consulting firm DRG given what you've got the people they get together for some it's like oh my goodness she was kind of start pilot lumber, reach the woman in get sure that went off into space in terms of trying to imitate with 11.5 so I was impressed after hellos and what not seen you folks split all these parties and two different groups so they have wanted to separate thinking processes John was being green a and then and then the lay down the ground they called us to assume that were designing a warning marker for humans not aliens not cyborgs but for human being biologically identical to us but who's alive 500 or 5000 or 10,000 years from now how can you make a message that not human will understand in white light 10,000 years as far as I can determine leaving the logic seemed to be well if we told them to design a marker the last 250,000 years that clearly are ridiculous and absurd proposition 10,000 years doesn't sound quite so crazy so it was it was just pulled out of the air in other words even though this site is going to be radioactive for hundreds of thousands of years this panel is only responsible for keeping this place sufficiently labeled for humans the next 10,000 years but get some perspective about where humanity was 10,000 years ago back then it was a hot new technology taking the world by storm it was called farming for the agricultural revolution human subsisted as gatherer hunters biologically we are the same people we were 10,000 years ago semester going back over 40,000 years but culturally we share almost nothing with these people definitely not language well know because the linguists tell us that language changes language has a half-life just like radioactive materials on the half-life in his half-life isn't very long think about Shakespeare my cousin Westmoreland's name I think is a lack like .it might immediately springs but this don't chitchat general's office.  Some of the words are powerful e-book tenaciously think one but help preschoolers can get through it although Shakespeare was only 400 years ago 4% of 10,000 years flat so that the Beowulf Way, God – not minimal English failed to Catherine leave the incomprehensible as a lead frame it on offshoot shaving share than a threat now reflecting different language and I know you can't see this because this is radio but trust me it's just as confusing on the written page you can recognize most of the letters as being part of the English alphabet but they'd barely correspond with how we use those letters today and that's from year 1010% of 10,000 years there are some languages that are very resistant to change that his languages that get enshrined in biblical text in religious texts Latin Hebrew Arabic those are sure that either the oldest written textile back to each and Samaria about 4600 years ago in those languages are long since dead and that's not even the halfway mark of our time for self both team a NTB at the with brainstorming session realized pretty quickly that every language on the planet today could be gone well before 10,000 years and how can you start a conversation with somebody that you have no common language with both groups went sure about this then he thought this to be something better than language symbols symbols pictures there are some facial expressions which are pretty universal like :-) 2.rise half circle for amount and taking on the floor like 'Mr. Yahoo if you were alive in the 80s email as you is the as they me it's a logo of a green phase with squinty eyes stuck out tongue the face looks like it's about basic that it was designed to be put on cleaning products and other household poisons to let kids know that whatever's inside it's going to be horrible for you and so think along those lines they considered another logo which they thought might be universal actually Carl Sagan proposed Sagan couldn't make panel but he sent a letter saying this whole market problem was easy you just need the right symbol and he knew just the one skull across the Colorado death incarnate well Dino Rizzo crossbows came from now now don't the earliest uses of it are in religious paintings and sculptures from Middle Ages where at the foot of the cross where Jesus was crucified there's a scroll with two bones in the shape of a cross not index the shape of a cross Adams goal and the bones are the symbol of the resurrection will so instead of being a symbol of death it was a symbol of resurrection and rebirth but fast forward a couple of centuries this allotted trade going on merchant ships traveling to and fro and in the ship's log if the sailor died the captain would put a little scroll and crossbones next to his name and a lot of the sailors came to associate that symbol with death the rebirth part of it was kind of lost fast-forward another century you got tired out marauding on the high seas they plundered of the boats installed a cargo along the way some pilots relied they could use a symbol to let their targets no who they were a branding campaign to terrify their targets into compliance you to make clear where pirates and if you don't surrender were going to kill you and your death but there are actually several different icons that pirates used for example a heart with blood dripping outfit that was a popular pirate flag and even more popular symbol was an hourglass and hourglass hourglass met if you don't surrender in a certain amount of time will show you will so the hourglass for a while was that was the most feared pirate symbol within one of the logos got famous 17 2013 how do Jack Rackham was captured and put on trial in the legal proceedings it came out that two of the Pirates and how projects crew were women and that one of them was pregnant with calico Jack's child this was the tablet scandal of the day and everyone in England was reading about this trial anyway just to happen that calico Jack's symbol was the Jolly Roger though in his case the bones were replaced with a pair of cross swords quick aside the name Jolly Roger is probably in English corruption of the French show you lose or pretty red because the original pirate flags or read not black after that child the skull and cross bones started showing up on book covers for drive in front of novels the skull and cross bones was permeating culture as a symbol of danger jump ahead to the late 1800s by factories in Germany started using the skull and cross bones as a symbol for place half a century later the Nazis adopted it as the civil further SS deficit divisions so the skull and cross bones came to be associated with danger and death around the world but it didn't become universal not really think about what's happened with the skull and cross bones last 2030 years gone mainstream now you'll see it on kids book bags on onesies for infants you can even buy water bottles with the skull and cross bones so much for the whole poison thing in the original meaning as it pertained to Adam in the resurrection is long gone the lesson that was that we got from this is that symbols can change I can graphical drift happens in the having touched on cultural interpretation like there's a candy company Mexico call my Katrina and their logo logo that goes on the packaging for this week is at least call and so to bring his back to the website in New Mexico the teachings is my people at wit realized that symbols couldn't be trusted to mean the same things over time Idea we could tell a little story using stick figures visual storytelling that stick figure like any by the orchestra you circle on top trunk two arms and 2X why well there are two things that seem to be universal the human heart one is a stick figure and you find them all drawn on the walls of the caves in the cave paintings that are 25,000 years old by the way may be the only piece of graphic art surviving for more than 10,000 years that is art which we can draw me and John says there's another convention that is universal a sequence of events for sysop and then this happened in this so like and a narrative story and article storyboarded, strip just find it everywhere and in fact you can even define a symbol using stick figures check that let's do a simple comic strip so first frame you put a small child in the child is in from a small plant sap second frame that child is a little bit bigger now and the sapling behind was grown a little bit then next to the child is eight barrel and on that barrel is the symbol for radiation the trefoil symbol and the child is touching that barrel the third frame you have full grown big old tree that a child that is now an adult human being except the person is lying on the ground presumably dead exes over their eyes :-( mouth and the barrel now with the trefoil symbolism open and so clearly the idea is don't touch anything with the trefoil symbol released not a barrel of course you read it from right the lessons of totally different story the old guy who is sick discovers the fountain of youth and he's reborn okay all is not lost maybe you could use the arrows arrows are universal or maybe you could situate the various comic strips in a sequence that you can only see sequentially based on how their arranged in space so maybe it's possible to create a universally recognizable warning sign that way but really regardless of whatever symbol were trying to come up with their whatever story that would try to tell you can actually build something make something like a physical tangible things can last 10,000 years the brain stormers that whip thought about building something from solid gold well if it happened to get stolen Maureen Kaplan the archaeologist who have realized the same thing metals and get recycled felt no bronze aluminum that basically means you with rocks and rocks can erode and who knows the giant monolith could be useful to some future desert person you could you just tip it over on side and then you have a foundation for your house here is the critical moment where all the obvious choices have been exhausted language symbols and storyboards were going to cut it usually plans the website start getting really you whack there was this one guy Maureen's group name Mike Mike Burrell is a landscape architect and an artist Bill has since passed away but Marine members in the group prohibits revelation don't actually need to transmit information into the future all you need to do is make somebody scared of being in that place he was trying to the landscape such that it itself gave a warning to work and he was thinking on a massive scale scale.  Neither like one drive which might halt the landfill for drawing of these needle sharp pointed angular jutting up around the own the earth itself as make the land itself, and by lesson you want to do is draw people to see this incredible work of art Garcia restricts future half-mile of these giants like Rachel is itself society build a hotel for them to stay in and they decided to go well for water in there you are just cause exactly what you're trying to avoid when all was said and done both groups submitted their proposals but Sandia labs found most of the ideas a little too pie-in-the-sky here's Roger Nelson the chief scientist at the Department of Energy's Carlsbad Field office which owns and operates with actually build any markers you need to be constructed at a reasonable cost because it's just not right to ask real current generations of real people today Tetris sacrifice to their tax dollars or whatever to invest in protecting the hypothetical intruder into some very far future from a risk for which there is likely no harm to the result inside the panel than that to figure out the Widmark system was actually not the first instance of thinkers being brought together to consider how to communicate the dangers of nuclear waste over time there was one such meeting in 1981 to the Yucca Mountain project which was eventually scrapped in the get command project had probably the craziest idea proposed that even though it was never suggested for with his become the 99 PI in-house favorite method of connecting with people 10,000 years in the future by the probably reason my wood in the story at all call it the rake at solution my hands-down favorite approach came from these two European philosophers François bastide and Paolo for Bree it goes like this Julie got thinking that the most durable thing that humanity has ever made his culture religion folklore police systems sure they morph over time essential message can get poultry and so Stephen for Greece had visible didn't genetically engineered species of that changes color in the presence of radiation then the release them out into the wild,
Geiger counters that's just a number 172 people create entire system of folklore about so we will sing songs about them we will draw pictures of them will tell stories about and like any good story there's more that when you see the cats turn color run far far as I tell so I a 13 Embedded into our culture the knowledge it contains can evolve with us even as a language shifts 10,000 years about the songs in the stories may sound incomprehensible to us but as long as they communicate this idea but it's not safe to be with the cats change colors we will have done our job may the rate cats keep us safe the plan that Sandia labs decided to move forward with does not involve breakouts family or a landscape of thorns it doesn't even involve the skull and cross bones architectural design includes a big firm 30 feet high person construction around the footprint of the repository that's Roger Nelson again the chief scientist overseen with at the end of the day the powers that be decided to go with solutions that the payments and pretty much cast aside their marking the area with large granite monuments large granite monument should each corner in the middle and several buried libraries there will be information in seven languages the six linkages of the UN Arabic Chinese English French Russian Spanish and also Navajo because it's the most prevalent indigenous language of the area the plan is still being finalized
talk about protecting people that are great great great great great great great great great great grandkids will never know we have a duty to warn the responsibility to mark the after a certain point yesterday wondering like this is a bit ridiculous mother researching story I read about the town called out the small family African-American community about our our South Florida in 19 67 million processing plant was set up in the middle of the manufactured Holy Spirit to the and also the pieces of the Hubble space telescope anyway it turned out that the claim was never very good about dealing with the beryllium dust and other toxins made their way into the town's groundwater how about that always got its water from shallow well resident started noticing that a lot diagnosed with cancer and other diseases including really… Which you get from exposure to really tell filed a lawsuit against the company that owns the Lockheed Martin and likely spent years trading on the loss now the reason I bring this up is because Lockheed Martin happened to me at Sandia national the corporation that runs the website over the next in this case appellant is hardly unique and there are literally thousands of pounds approximately as many of them low income or communities of color that have become contaminated in similar ways and so the 10,000 year with marker system feels really noble but maybe a little misguided I am all for taking care of people 10,000 years in the future think the best way to do that is to start taking care of people that are alive today that way there might be humans in 10,000 years and get don't go don't think is is there a
