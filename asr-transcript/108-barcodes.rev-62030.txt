the barcode has come to represent everything they hate about capitalism and consumers also you can get wrap candies of every kind bubble gum, lolly pops fun sized candy bars just a dollar eight nine when I was a punk kid if a bands had a barcode on it we knew they were complete sell outs they were so with the market's fault that is become the symbol of the live of technology were afraid of her don't understand or being the card can wield in a larger monolithic machine the matrix if you will the live well to what industry wedding I am the founder of Azalea software here in Seattle 110 I've been writing software that prints barcodes for 25 years now the art bad they are good there just tools but most people look at them and don't even know where to start so let's demystify from minute and look at what's inside the box again what were talking about here is the UPC barcode that George Laura invented as the barcode that you and I and everyone in the world has had the most interaction with the UPC barcode is divided into two hats it's actually to barcode sitting right next to each other you can see this visually because there are these longer cars that come down in the middle and on each side is a competent guide bars and I burst how this can add that the code is starting and ending the left half of the barcode tells you who the manufacturer is in the right have tells you which particular product it is and is something I didn't realize the scanner is reading both the light and the dark lines to understand the scanner just consider yourself the dark room where the wall behind you has participated on it in your general flashlight and shined it over your head across the bars you would see the room got a little wider when your world the white bars that it would get dark when it was overlooked on black lines that don't reflect the laser light back to the scanner register as one white lines equal zero they're actually 95 evenly spaced columns on a UPC barcode of thick black line is actually a bunch of ones are next to each other the computer adds all that together and get a string of 12 numbers this number goes to the computer the computer know what's up in this table to get the information such as what is the product how much they're charging for but that is not in the barcode the only thing it's in the barcode is where the computer should look this number is also printed below the blackhead just in case the scanner isn't working which can mean really makes the whole ministry of little anti-kind take any TrackBack so when most people want to recently thought of barcodes they thought of something that was a combination of bars and stripes more recently two-dimensional barcodes which are they look like crossword puzzles have emerged the most popular being QR barcodes quick response that are scanned by cell phones we've all seen these and maybe if you must have actually bothered to pull out our cell phones and download the app required to scan the Aniston that I find China's Lane are annoying in excite no chilies I don't want more info on the blooming onion so if you did you might know that the blooming onions from outback so anyway I googled my IQ lack had slain and I got a bunch of articles basically saying that actually released on they just being misused Mosley by advertisers and to start slapping them on every single thing that Jerry lighting he still believes in them the nice thing about QR barcodes as they are not just the lookup number to an external database yes it can be a chunk of text it can be a URL it can be a whole lot of different things but there is no central authority that tells you what or how to do anything meaning you don't have to get to GS one to get a key lack of it which lets people D stuff like make a giant picture of Amy Goodman's face entirely out of DUI because this is my QR code Amy Goodman portrait made in 2304 unique QR codes that link to nine years of democracy now videos besides the QR code Lauren Woodland's original barcodes have spawned a bunch of other archives that are used for all sorts of things there's code 128 which is used for packaging and shipping is language it is by the post office to sort now their barcode phase radio frequencies defend outdated anaconda RFID tags and they are very barcodes in all pages get put in the same category because like barcodes are being used to keep track of inventory with a grocery cart full of RFID tag items one could conceivably wield their card through a big hoop that would read all the contents all it wants basically eliminating the checkout line entirely allowing more people to pass to stores even more quickly that we can all buy more stuff my current topics prescriptions library.luggage injured animals that are so many bipeds on so many things that according to Jay Whiting one future archaeologists come across remnants of our backward as civilization I stumble across a barcode big and assignment religious significance don't understand the supply chain we had no idea how far was going it we thought it would stay just within the grocery industry of course it didn't test today in the grocery industry actually went way beyond all the way to conspiracy there is in fact a silly conspiracy theory that all barcodes have the number of the beast 666 encoded yeah it has to do with those guidelines that comment the beginning middle and end of every biped and it's basically true that there are three sixes colluded in the guide buyers the answer to why is a bit technical you can read about it on George lawyers personal website in the FAQ section if you want that as exhibit B I submit George himself well hello George J Laura after we were identify energy and he was talking a little
