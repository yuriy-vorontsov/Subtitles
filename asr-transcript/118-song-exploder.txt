This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars persecution way as a podcast song exploder the concept is simple but brilliant past positions to take part one of their songs and go through it piece by piece and let listeners hear what's going on inside something tracks and reveal the secrets of what went into making song whether it's some of the sounds inside of it were just the memories of what they were going through when their greetings since officers and because you mind me saying this kind of a design show about music a 99% is available for sauce as in the very first episode of sonics were pretty interviewed Jimmy Tamura of the band the Postal Service and invited him to take a deep dive into each individual element of the song the District sleeps alone tonight if the something monitoring out if you don't already own the loan Postal Service album you made some poor choices and serious anyway this is Jimmy temporarily isolating backing vocal track sung by Jenny Lewis failure some of Jenny's backing vocals soloed out he the since umbrella was looking to add more texture to the final Mets this on any had these beautiful backing vocals it might've been just an accident with a delay pedal that is Luke Obuchi's vocals and made into texture in the sun is one of the lessons that we put into the into district complainant part of this booklet comes in after the second wristlets, going into the more dancy after the third here's a risqué Shirley from song exploder I'd heard that song the District sleeps alone tonight so many times since it came out 2003 thank you that part I knew that found I had no idea that was a human voice making sound until he took everything away and that was the first exodus are like the the pilot before the show is called fungus B for one of those are figuring it out and went to a fight that part I of this that this is this is the reason why he and a radio show was born podcast what I'm supposed to like a magic trick where the intention is to fool the audience into thinking that their experience is something that they aren't if you're learning all the secrets of a song the ideas still to just create a musical experience for you that you enjoy and if you like you went to know more about it than you can have a richer enjoyment of release that's how it is for me so surreal today were in a feature a recent episode of some exporter all about the theme song to the Netflix original series house of cards this is one of my favorite episodes because it reveals so much about all the thought that goes into making a theme song is purchase with the composer Jeff Beal's home in Los Angeles and he described his collaboration series executive producers David Fincher and Bo Willman how they establish the tone in the Skokomish and how the music name change from season one season to taking notice Chernoff go back different you're currently hearing this is one by the way there sounds a guard season one spoilers ahead to what series composer Jeff feel talking to her schedule on size and just feel composer I do the music for health cards I had worked with David Fincher on a commercial probably about six or seven years ago and this was around the time I been working on Rome radio so I saw the trays of his show is happening with David's name attached and I kept in touch and we never worked together since I thought this might be good good match for us you know watch a little bit of the British owner was the biggest part I pitched David is a decisive use the Rome thing I said well us if you know Rome was a pure drama was very much about politics and sort of operatic scale test and storytelling after I first met with David to sort talk about the project because initial thoughts about musically server heads together based on his sort of way of thinking about music and how much music informs destroy CFE asked me to write some sketches before he started shooting a course before we have a meeting in the form of his sketches the shared with me I think about for five scripts early drafts of what became season one so it was very much those those in some language in the ways are created this world and inspired some of the early early work losing alike three shows a sort of dark humor to it and I see the added the music definitely find a way to sort of give audience permission the sort of laugh the sardonic darkness course 1C call me anyhow he gave me some his thoughts on it which were interesting and in some of them surprisingly needs there is one song really like the Supertramp crime of the century great songs the section of that song for the end where it just becomes a sort of driving peace this is the sort of Pavarotti for classes amend and gravitas but but it also had a very gritty earthy almost jazzy bluesy transportation rock 'n roll note we dissected that together and sort of thought about why that spoke in that's the show the show was it's all about the underbelly of Washington the dark corners what you don't see really happens poses sort of the West Wing no heroic more aspirational the survey over the chief you know Washington that your typical sort of film score gestures about the capital of politics I wrote about four sketches for David one of the things we talk about our first meeting releasing economy to call arms and when you listen to it it has a lot of the elements that became the main title theme is that the baseline it's got that sort of cloud of dark electronics insert proceeded like father something in the tune is there although in this case it was displayed by the camera very simple orchestration and then this been the second time he goes around here comes in very simple but there's a gym and then his little sequences accords and melody part of the reason sketching is useful because it's like the bones of something if the structure of the skeleton is has integrity it should be able to stand without an abundance of sort of instrumental embellishment and so by sketching and by doing simple versions of themes you are able to sort of make sure that you have an idea I was thought of this is sort of the professor seeing the idea like Kevin Spacey's characters justice for the manipulator who is a virtuoso at pulling strings on people and getting them do what he wants to do but the reason I'm sharing this one in the context of the main title was when we got around to finally doing the arrangement David said he be cool of the main title felt like the sort of stew of a lot of different elements from the score which would then be deconstructed into its individual parts so you hear this sort of descending chromatic line in the high piano that became one of the signature the main title sequence as the sketch grows the electric bass comes in so it's the sort of minimalist piano motif by putting that they center is forgiven the attention of something that's pushing against David and I talked about the piano will because I was in the Supertramp Cubans instrument I like a lot of it felt like a good instrument for Kevin's character because it can be very precise and very mechanical away which I love about it this recall arms thing that was dropped in the main title sequence in a never left once it was in there that was will review do and I started in a few passes through I started work on the arrangement the story of the main title sequences visually lyrical flowing with the armor this came straight from sort of those original scripting in the main title it's basically the whole idea of the sun going down Washington in a starting and really broad daylight as a sequence progresses you end up at night so you so there was a way in which you went from something very open and airy and licenses like the darkness falling it out so that was that was a little bit of visual storytelling thing I try to play off of the first thing we hear is the fog the fog of the club Dumas is a sort of low since grown shortly after that comes the baseline which I know David affectionately referred to as the riptide I was like the descriptions, the idea of something that pulls you under the basically the combination of several things it's analog the models and things are designed some of my head for a long time this couple differentsamples mixed together but I also recorded a live bass player playing the plane the part session my son Henry who is a wonderful young musician is actually now setting jazz bass the base I was so important in the orchestration was getting big enough I actually record the basement octave above it gives enough bit rate content so that when all is a list of is happening that basis of driving one of the fun things about the composition for me was that the harmony changes a lot over that baseline fact bases always playing a minor but the harmony sometimes goes a major decrease this very strange dissonance in the sense of collision basically along no notes like bass players playing the wrong nobody was out run over existing brain scans on logic to it some like Frank will push through anything he doesn't carry second stop playing those notes in my original sort of call arm sketch two times through its kind of the original demo was almost long enough to cover the main title sequence weenies more time nice distraction from David to sort of work in another theme so what I did with a kind of extended the intro I had a lot of percussion but I also added the little puppetmaster riff but then an you know that thing it has a slightly different occasions because this is an 44 in the proper master seems those in three phrases are broken up little bit but it's sort of it still got that descending chromatic line another layer that was sort of one of the last things I came up with but was really useful as the trumpet from the player and again is the most expected cliché thing you'd hear in a show about Washington would be that sort of military trumpet, things because were seeing the sort of iconic shots of Washington the distal right to have something that references that I can't does obviously the rest of the composition is telling you that this is in the heroic version of the Lincoln Memorial and Washington monument Ms. away which sort lonely to me to I like this are the loneliness of it one of the things David visually did was to pull out a lot of the people in some of the time up shots he had it was much creepier seeing some of the shots with no people in them it just made it feel like it was a ghost town or was that the sort of surreal quality to it basically in talking to David Fincher about the second season I was so surprising me but we were spotting the first couple episodes users couldn't argue notes on the main title about what he wanted different you know David saw the second season is even more operatic and darker to this shocking make of the first season was pretty dark but you know everybody is you seen who Frank is and what he can do now these killed somebody in the first season and it's obviously very nice can get away what this guy wants to do for in general for main titles your people get attached especially like something does very careful you know to like steer the ship enough but not so far as to make you feel like your old friend was not girlfriend anymore so I added some voices some voice samples to a lot of it I also added some some low strings to the intro the high string line these to be edited and edited a user for messaging we just do that in and in the chilly so again is lower everything sort of skewing downstream darker so that it feels like this cloud is sort of come over the whole thing the sort of lightness and sense of that type of energy is dissipated you know he's no longer the puppetmaster exerted vice president of season two we know he's he's very much in commands of his lesson again going on in much more of a it's it's like be sent to the throne nothing so many networks labor so makers are afraid of a real main title sequences are old-fashioned idea but the whole idea of a of a little mini film that sells you in the world and get you ready to experience something is a wonderful sort of us Tories on device you know it's sort of frames a moment for you and gets you settle into what you're about to take in now here's season to version the main title theme house of cards a him and a in him
