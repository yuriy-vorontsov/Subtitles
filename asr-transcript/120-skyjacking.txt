This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars the term hijacking goes back to prohibition days when gangsters would stop trucks carrying moonshine and may come up to the kind of tab with their pistol and point in their face and said Holger hands hijack and it took all liquor and a drive of the truck it is the early days of commercial air travel the thought that someone would hijack a plane was scarcely even considered when they created the oversight of aviation nation 58 the Congressional law that did that did not make hijacking a crime because no one had for seen that anyone in a country like America where theoretically he wanted to go somewhere you can just buy a ticket to go there no one to assume that any American ever do this in Brendan I Koerner author of this guys belong to us love in terror in the Golden age of hijackings as that the design of airport terminals reflected is hard to fathom now you could literally you get out of a taxi at the curb and walked to the terminal walk onto the tarmac to the top of the boarding stairs and on the plant itself without a ticket without showing anyone your identification so that anyone searching your personal or your luggage anyway she performs so it was a very much similar to getting our train and I was by design by airlines then starting in 1961 in epidemic of hijackings begin it really was an epidemic and I mean that in saying that did the virus the behavioral virus mutated over time become the basic features of these hijackings changed the first phase of skydivers all wanted passage to Cuba May 1, 1961 was the first American hijacking perpetrated by Antonio Ramirez Ortiz he was kind of a somewhat mentally disturbed electrician Miami who got on a key westbound flights and announced with a holy and NATO pilots wrote that he had been hired to assassinate Castro.Castro and wanted to go there to warn Castro about this I have had to do is in the second phase the sky divers broaden their horizons to more distantly my favorite example is a man in Iraqi amenity out of with Italian-American Marine who actually went from Los Angeles to row Dorsey was hell is a hero and landing action going to 18 months in prison the time of his x-ray camera she charged with hijacking any action of after that am signing a contract start spaghetti Western felt very good-looking guy then schedule is morphed in the classic kidnappers demanding ransom manager this was a minimizer gets Berkeley unemployed truck driver had a dispute the IRS and here she hijacked plane from Phoenix to Washington DC where he demanded $100 million in cash to be given in the Supreme Court she was enraged and taking his tax case seductress of his last phase of the epidemic people start asking for tons of money in gold bars and crates of liquor and cigarettes and an aching heart desired hundred thousand in cash getaway car Anna M stricken from the English language in all the while hijacking was never considered that serious a threat by the airlines or the passengers really it was more making TVs anything else the assumption the part of passengers was that well-being of the airlines will flies down Havana the hijacker be taken off the plane may get to spend the night the van I will become up in a hotel baby bison cigars and Enron from relatives and go see the section with radio and will have a story to tell the next cocktail party back in the US it was taken lightly because the notion that this could really be something destructive intern in the mass murder was not some a people's minds at that time because this guy jacking's word especially violent and the passengers were yet demanding extra security the airlines fought to keep things exactly as they were the airlines were scared they thought that if they treated all their customers, criminal suspects because they were merely flying that people would find more people would drive their destinations instead to the airlines took a lot of roadblocks whenever someone special in government mention the concept of having physical screening of all passengers they would shoot that down on these all their older lobbyist muscle should that down they really forced the FAA's hand to come up with the Wii guests that must have been security improvements the FAA the Federal Aviation Administration is the US government body that is responsible for the safety and regulation of civil aviation this is all in the name of well we can put us in hijackings in this cost is however 2030 grand for hijacking in terms of loss convenes and whatnot or they could pay millions and millions on x-ray machine screenings and security personnel for the airlines that the smart financial choice was clear up with periodic hijackings comply totally and keep the customer experience the ground the same but clearly something had to be done if the airlines were unwilling to consider mandatory screening and checkpoints inside the terminals some less intrusive and somewhat zany or solutions had to be considered so in 1968 the FAA created a special anti-hijacking task force on to come up with some solution of be palatable to the airlines – he opened up for public comment and invited the public to submit suggestions about how this can be done the most common suggestion was complete capitulation quote provide free transportation to Cuba for those persons leaving the United States" and another tactic that was seriously considered by the Federal Aviation Administration was to build a phony Havana airport in South Florida the ideas that it is timeless skydivers want to go to Havana so you, just fly them out over the water and in turn back in an land of this figure for an arrest them and they got off the plane big idea just be too expensive they would have cost prohibits it can do that solution but there were also a lot of delightful federal solutions whose patents are so much fun to read there is a hijack rejections there was also one patent for an injector seat which would have a quote hypodermic injection apparatus arranged for driving the needle of a hypodermic syringe the seat cushion into the passenger to instantly sedate or kill the passenger okay the more you write what Wiley coyote there was a trap door that was patented that would go right out of the cockpit and lock the hijacker Plexiglas chamber that we could be brought to justice when the plane landed the public propose that pilots depressurized aircraft are expelled gas throughout the cabin so that everyone falls asleep in the crew would go out with oxygen tanks and consumer hijacker one I logged she was giving all the passengers boxing gloves and where boxing gloves duration of the flight and theory being that you can't holding gun boxing gloves on your hands of course then there would be an epidemic of extremely ill-advised boxing matches at 30,000 feet but did the real thing if it going with was this girl profile now sure the one thing about that the airline terminals or was one place you had to halt generally now is at the ticket agents to get a boarding pass or to purchase a ticket there are many more tickets purchased on-site at that time to this is the one chokepoint in the terminal experience with the ticket counter the FA solution was to train the ticket agents in this 25 behavioral cues that might indicate someone is a potential sky Jack are these were things like not maintaining appropriate eye contact not caring about your luggage wearing military surplus gear and you saw any of these traits behavioral traits in a customer coming through to get a ticket or a boarding pass you would very discreetly asked that they go to a room on the side and be searched this was not a good solution in the real problem is that ticket agents are not security personnel there dealing with hundreds upon hundreds upon hundreds of often very harried customers per day and said there other people to really identify even if you assume these behavioral Q2 boss work it turned out to be a bad assumption because plenty of sky doctors passed through without notice it was meant to be very low impact solution at the one show point that already existed in airports and it was really a failure but the solution that we all know that eventually came up with screening everybody and their luggage with x-ray machines and requiring ID all the things that make the airport the horrible place to this wasn't seriously considered until one hijacking changed everything this is a really forgotten really pivotal moment in American security history this is on November 1972 had a tail end of this year… Been really crazy hijackings what happened next people asking for huge amounts of money then you have these three are fugitives from the law who hijacked a Southern Airways flight 49 – acetate into Detroit had a grievance the Detroit police and they wanted $10 million and they said they didn't get it there are going to crash the plane in choosing the appropriate national laboratory in your Knoxville Tennessee at the heart of the laboratory is actually a uranium 235 reactor all of a sudden everyone realized an airplane could be a weapon of mass destruction in this case threatening to turn Eastern Tennessee into a nuclear waste and naturally when the light goes on for the airlines and the government that the current situation is no longer tenable fortunately the escapes cataclysm there what happens is the airline does not mind are the 2 million Heidegger's landed in Chattanooga Tennessee pick up the can be hijacked by that time acting drunk on the liquor on the planes were completely bombs and they bring up 50 pounds cash loan money in the big $10 million and so that she didn't bother to count Everett campus much money hijackers eventually landed their plane in Havana Cuban authorities Crisis averted but shortly after that you have the Executive Order mandating universal physical screen is starting January 5, 1973 in Airlines flight the airlines really wanted the government to provide airport security but the government refused and the airlines hired contractors to do airport screenings and run the metal detectors but the airlines desperately trying to avoid and they put them in jail for making 73 and there is literally not a single hijacking an American airspace that year there were 159 sky Jack and the US from 1961 to 1972 they really change the nature of air travel even though most of this history is completely forgotten along with the payments of the deranged desperate lone hijacker in military surplus the public conception of the hijacker change dramatically in the 80s in response to specific leave beyond to a hijacking in Lebanon in 1985 and all the sudden you hijacking associated with Islamic terrorism a real kind of scary prospect something that people didn't understand the real bogeyman for people at that time so I think once we can't have that image that famous image of the pilot of that plane on the on the tarmac in Beirut with his captor with gun to his head meeting out of the cockpit we complete forgot about these kind of more quaint hijackers want to go to the van and a bad experience in Vietnam as I think about more this is really scary or crime crime of kind of an enemy we don't really understand or know very much about answer that earlier air was forgotten papers over if you will abide by this new image of who the hijacker was and that image remains today reinforced of course by the terror attacks on 911 2001 a date which is preceded by an entire decade free of any commercial airlines carjackings in US airspace after 9/11 the airlines finally got with a lobby for back when mandatory screenings were introduced in 1973 the government took over security of our nation's airports and
