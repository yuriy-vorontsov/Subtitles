This is 99% invisible I'm Roman mark this time you should really long time on a Friday afternoon.  This deleted to be a way to steal something and get it out of the guiding principle is no cost when I go into a bank especially if I can stand in line waiting to make the bond my mind wanders the first places it wonders to is however conflicts a look at the exits and entrances the layout of the building how could be done most of the time buildings are our friends but it's fun to recast the bill as the end of the obstacle to overcome I guess it's anything we need I will that's pretty entertaining the huddle and how to get the money out of the pain is one that I can estimate how long time first equity income every place to basically ever since Institute 90 9 PM hey people thinking that they will need three people will try to their own way to be a bag with designs that go from the spectacularly complicated to the deceptively simple oh and one of them actually.  Several thought I don't the Los Angeles California saline and again, designer and artist I'm based in London my wick relates to the idea that design to be a plot and I think wind fascinated why is a fascinating then asked friends see you have absolute freedom to fantasize about what everyone with mind gain or set out to make her heist is big and complicated as possible a sort of go big or go home style heist and she was interested in the interplay between Hollywood movies and Pat Heise and real life case is Israeli weighted feedback plates that happen in Hollywood Hollywood baying the intrinsic poll on everything that relates to the iconography of a heist so of course her heist had to take place in LA there were years mostly in the 70s 80s and 90s when LA was accurately dabbed his bank robbery capital world particularly bad years there were as many as 2600 bankruptcies in LA that's roughly one robbery every 45 minutes of the working people of conjectured about why they said anything that maybe the whole of Hollywood part of the physical layout of LA the land-based construct additional of the field highways it's actually very easy to get away as long as you're not trying to get away during rush hour to be fair to LA their bank robberies that are way less jaw-dropping according to the FBI there were only 212 reported bank robberies in 2013 let's get to gainers next chapter ones could the distraction of what Wilshire painter romantic dinner.  If underway this is a picture this plane takes off from Los Angeles international Airport on Tuesday morning at precisely 9:46 AM its assignment to deliver a full-scale replica of the 747 commercial jet to a film set most flying over downtown LA the cables holding the replica set dropping the playing 10,000 feet crashing into the government building one Wilshire one Wilshire is a 28 story building in downtown most of it is filled with computer servers and telecommunications equipment did the gold is to drool Crouse of passes by and preoccupied a police from what's really going on and was really going on is that while every emergency responder in LA is busy with the distraction at one Wilshire five different banks and the surrounding area are being robbed the gain is plan involves stealing the actual Saints faults because of where the big money it's become as a little now that there is not told $2000 in one say say.  For example they would tête-à-tête is behind each cubicle he made 10 people in the any amount you have again is a is a limit of $2000 in ancient face cubicles gainers plan was to drill large concentric circles into the banks and pull out the vaults and then loaded onto trucks we could call circles that gets similar in size as you reach the fault and as you pull pull the goods back could say rips the building and can't say that the building could collapse on it same way after you left's leaving traces on trying to diminish the amount of evidence possible Dana get an increasing string if the gap size and involves the layout of the building is working with a group of students from the Art Ctr., College of design in LA and we had better off questions in the buildings in a kind of place in the where architecture students who want to find out how how deep the building guys and so on as announcing as the sizes of all the faults of one Juan was still trying to work out as we contacted the clean out of his way to one of the banks but entering that vault holds is very difficult not all of the research has been difficult like watching lots and lots of heist movies the anything the one he won a half insane ironically is inside mind and people keep telling me to watch and I keep meaning say it is one I'd like to say that because I'm told is very good actually you are hello my name is Russell Gewirtz on the writer of the film inside men starring Jodie Foster quite phone themselves in the early 2000 towards living in New York City he was in a screenwriter had nothing to do with Hollywood I hadn't gone to film school ahead and read a book on screenwriting or anything he was just a guy working in real estate that like me apparently one of the people like thinking about the best way to rob a bank for my daily commute was that I'd walk for my apartments my car a few blocks and one half empty bank every day when I was lucky that this bank that's what popped my head so it was sort of like this it was just this few minutes of my day every morning and everything where I would end up working on this fantasizing about the story in my mind contact for about three years courts constructed the perfect heist in his mind before he ever wrote down a word for most of the time of the ever really intended to write a movie it was just you know just the drink he knew you when it is has to take place in manhattan and it took him a while to figure out what kind of think it would be if you think about it the story is dependent upon the wii architecture few over the structure as i was writing it i had to have a sense of okay is this a modern bank with glass countertops see everything that's going on or is it old and just has smaller windows and committee sometime during the upcoming we see a little because that was good to determine how you know a lot of the action in the film so the fun of it the great part is that as i'm writing it up i really get to build the bank however i wanted to be like that forth in the building is a classical high ceilings marble floors olivia is uncomfortable in a way that big-city thing seems to be needed has no windows in front to the police have very little idea about what's going on inside with all the bank robbers and hostages and i just think what we had been told by investigators at enron okay spoiler alert had been hyphenated names you have a group of masked robbers enters the bank takes everyone all of the customers in all the bank employees hostage the robbers need all of the hostages take off their clothes but on the scene outfit the robbers are also any kind of jumpsuit he nearly ran right on it if i want to service as you can tell who's a hostage is robert even the hostages lose track toward the end of the living hostages and robbers all come out their hands because interest exactly the same the police have no idea who was a hostage who was a rather a question everyone but they still can't figure it out and eventually they have to let them all go in a brilliant but there is still one problem it became clear to me that he is clever as it was to type an address themselves up like the hostages there is still needed to be a way to steal something and get it out of the back and i couldn't i couldn't speak it out in unit with the hostages so i'm in the end i decided one of them had stay behind and from there he became wealthy stays behind these got it he has to be hiding and if he's going to be hiding it's got a be really clever and it has to be something that is hinted at throughout the entire movie while the robbers are in the bank they're doing something in a back room building something digging something it's unclear what's going on you think that maybe there digging a tunnel what they actually building is around a tiny cell with a false wall hidden behind some shelves in the basement of the bank they use the building itself as an unwitting, when the robbers the one who actually has the stolen goods as the state behind until all the boys are gone until they're done gathering evidence at the bank he has to stay in this little room for an entire week you know it's it's it's funny it's hard for me to know exactly how much of my intention execute through but when there when their hacking through the concrete floor they're building a toilet because of your hiding in a tiny cell for a week while again have to go somewhere and that's the thing about this heist it feels pretty believable there are no black boxes in this movie and europe to watching a movie and a bunch of crooks get to that unit to the safe and somebody just pulls out a piece of equipment from a backpack and sticks it on the lock and the benevolent lock opens that all the black box those nonexistent real world only exist in movies but even without black boxes a highly orchestrated heist with multiple players and lots of moving parts like the one inside man is really different from the reality of how most bank robberies take place according to the fbi's own statistics most bank properties are done by just a single person who presents a note to the teller and walks out without a lot of fanfare which is a fundamental principle of design if you want something to work and work well keep it simple i talked to location california illinois and wisconsin bill on the other people and talking to show i think that radiator as the creative exercise or not you know that's correct i i have unfortunately been convicted of 26 bank robbers in three different states in my case they call me the choirboy rather the fbi gave congress gained during the robbery he would stand with his hands folded on the counter had when i can see someone's hands that makes me very nervous self-interest is to make myself call the bank teller called just transform nicely to permit there everybody at ease tom always worked alone and he always used about the always read this is a bank robbery put all your money the bag thank you any have to be prepared for the talented to think the note is a joke it's interesting in the berkshire stride a little bit because your sort of in this zone and then the teller she looks of a mailing are you serious yes serious them because if you never experiences before and who has you think it's pd is a joke and link alone again the artist that we heard from earlier tom did his research especially at the beginning probably took 34 months of of research and a lot of observation the guiding principles you do not want get caught and as such you want to sort of in vision ulcers in different scenarios someone might engage in the bank a bank employee a bank customer what will you do when you if you reach an altercation what is your escape route is it might be different from your standard route every has be highly thought out tom's getaway vehicle was his bicycle so the first thing you do is figure out where he was going to leave the bike parked once inside robbing the bank from there i actually physically walk to throw in terms of the steps i would ask account the steps i would count the moves i would practice literally hundreds of times i had a small notebook and which i wrote down every single detail would you leave footprints police patterns possibilities high position traffic areas time spent a lot of time concerning the least and incompletely and intuitively he came to believe banks closest to top stations make for the softest targets tom think this is because when cops go out on dvd they tend to drag out a way station which means that takes them longer to get to the callbacks are not very many tended to rob banks into middle to upper class member so that it would look like it would support somebody writing away on a bicycle if you are in it to be a really top area are really working class area that would stand out now i did not lock up my bike as there was only away from that site 2 to 3 minutes over the course of four years tom's total close to $130,000 plus about $5000 for robbery he never used a gun then no one was ever physically hurt 20 and it has been running create contact careless stopped putting as much time planning did all the standard steps of what is the escape route was a ultra escape route but i did not really pay attention to like police in a will hang out and watch police patterns is very cocky time justice was eventually caught and spent nine years in prison design patterns paint in london know what else matters what heat the water, and i not myself as the federal government is the 1995 movie heat from director michael mann set in la of course and influence policy and i heist mastermind pizzerias is even one of the most perfect films i've ever seen icon of the same is not say that he has been my favorite thing he said michael menzie in prison he is the number one movie amongst convicts whatever they were all handout on saturday and he comes on tnt is on that time whatever it is you're doing you user set down on the watch is our craft projects shank you put it all aside for in the heist designers in our story aren't the only ones influenced by heat it was a real heist in la in 1997	the north hollywood shootout can actually watch and listen to parts of it online and i think that the robbery bank of america: arrive in all unfolds in a way that is suspiciously similar to the plot is ready with feedback link to happen in hollywood it seems we comes the highest life often imitates art in all these plans are only good as our cannot stress enough people crime doesn't pay if you must embark on a life of crime remember this don't let yourself get attached to anything you're not willing to walk out on a 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat
