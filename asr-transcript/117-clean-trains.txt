over the fence and the dog will bite them my said wife but that's what the dog was for razor wire topped fences) shepherds worked until the graffiti writers realized that they could distract the dogs of food and through the senses desperate people take desperate measures in the transit officials were desperate no one knew what to do hello until David Gunn and David gone and I was credited with the New York City transit authorities for six years from 1984 to 19 is the transit systems had holes of faith David Gunn would be right up in front to maintenance assemblies and loss things very easy town Ontario	Amtrak fallout is visible only came to New York City in 1984 my first reaction was no because it was just to be "situation than the actual words where suicide mission but then his mother stepped in at that point she was in her 80s she referred you better take that audio everybody only direct our mom's got the ground running with something he called McLean training programs and you cleanup and part yet we guess we got the cars clean but we also fixed the clean trade became sort of symbolic of the fact that the thing worked the difference between you and me and David gone when we see graffiti we think about in terms of aesthetics we may like it or hate it that we are reacting to it visually David gone on some right past all of those wild style letters and sees a transit system not doing its job is a graffiti… Because having equipment clean is part of maintenance for decades people in charge treated subway graffiti like it was a sanitation problem Gunn says all wrong it wasn't just a sanitation problem it was something else entirely Gannon says the root of the problem with MTA deferred maintenance program in the 70s New York City was broke in the city pays for a big chunk of the transit authorities operating budget sending MTA to reduce its budget because fewer people writing the some ways the MTA made the worst decision they cut back on the things that kept the subways running routine inspections replacing parts even subway mechanics and when you expect to happen happened family deteriorated breakdowns triple trains derailed nearly every two weeks and get this in 1981 there were 1800 subway car fires 1800 ridership should go down when there's 1800 fires no wonder David called the MTA a suicide mission delete time first he hired 1500 nonunion managers and increase repairs he rebuilt thousands of cars being new control cases repo trucks new motors air compressors and Motorola and the whole 9 yards the thing about maintenance sexy takes years to see improvements go new people needed to see something now or in this case not to something my approach was to drive the and it clean up the mess that made and fixed the equipment and we gradually drove a little bastards into a corner by little bastards if it's not obvious government everyone vandalizing the trends and easily get it figured out a way to do it systemically line by line again that's artist Caleb knew a line on the one line when the two line taking the seven line off the map for for graffiti writers whether fixed they didn't allow any graffiti on zero graffiti artist on the train car bombs in this case means covering the outset of the treatment graffiti if an artist manage that the MTA pulled it from the system even during rush hour it was her first.  At one one day I ended up on 500 cars out of service and it worked and people knew it because they could see she impossible not really graffiti New York City subways there is even an official date May 12, 1989 people remember the VJ day it is like their greatest generation moment for the people who rent subway system something else was the time when they were declaring victory the transit authority held a ceremony meant that it was join us a restraining job the a train all of the NT brass and a lot of employees were there Mayor Ed Koch was there to privately activated "for the update never to you at edited already seemingly commemorative T-shirts they were red I had the old New York City transit Authority logo on the download free that I work in answering the subway and wise elements graffiti I lived in New York for almost 10 years now and graffiti covered subway car pulled up to my stop wondered where did he go the answer might be more complex but this time for once the answer is simple you can point to a man David God given guns anechoic a lot of New Yorkers was no white light coming into the six the subway system and the two writers he was this Darth Vader character and you took away their fun and ultimately was better at taking away their phone then they were sustaining May 12, 1989 today subway graffiti died the story is not over graffiti didn't actually in the day L subway graffiti that because David Downs clean train program almost impossible for us on the outside to see it never leaves the train yards and a cruiser and control their constantly looking for graffiti and pulling it off with the crazy solvent for Stacy and they fit an international gallery of it in fact so the kid from Munich would go paint subways in Paris kidding in Paris would go pay subways and custard graffiti writers today are collectors heading in the Bluebonnet has not travel and aligned to the printed out on collections are judged by two things size and value the subway graffiti completist would have to hit 190 systems in 54 countries and as for value there's only one that matters is a real way of thinking in graffiti which I don't think it's entirely wrong… You're not a real writer until you got your peace on New York subway kind of like the holy grail of all trains in a right now spray painting a New York subway car is a felony if painters decline mean jail time thousands of dollars in fines graffiti artists have to ask themselves is this worth it I'm pretty notice talking on the max) Ivan about it because Nina it's it's not really something that people like great to paying the sum West that's that's very nice thank you for doing that stood opposite this is Jim or at least that's what he when you call in Jill is a graffiti artist from South Africa needs trains in countries around the world even when he said he was going to hit New York you can't think a concept not been on the we distorted Jo's boys to protect his identity it's only way that he would agree to talk to us there's never been caught but it's close I've looked Sena flashlight and turned around to tell the guy that someone is coming for us and when I tend run either ready like run we actually will guide for most writers Leslie would try to reach of security and going to what you're not missing the Marina he's been vice president of security for the MTA New York City transit easy guys from all over the world in New York's train yards the Marino didn't have hard numbers of who gets caught from where in the yard but when a train gets hit in New York the graffiti artist is more likely to be from say Spain or France not from New York some up at the ratio at some .8020 international folk cost a lot of money to your quality audit will also exit on the beach I would require a critical requirement to train your graffiti artists say that's part of the draw is a rush to bring a lot now want to get over this since it's hard to resist its exciting at first and I when you got inside to the yachting east on the flowing on the platform as you take this chain it is annoying on platform and train the trainer young floor next to the site I be 11 the smile on the found the summits of intense because you're ready like the novice it was, graduated it is not much affected before that him thanks edit in fact write better than money better than anything sits like other people do it
