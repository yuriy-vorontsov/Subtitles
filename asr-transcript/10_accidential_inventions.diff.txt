<p>Brought to you by the reinvented 2012 Camry it's ready are you will continue and half-hour or hey love fog had done Josh Clark is the right the end of the other you can see is that we are here is so<span style="background: #ffe6e6;">&hellip; Dgjigurda da da da da</span> They get them right and exempt it's a sufficient that you he did a great uncle I like easily top tens of either a nice digestible light form of hey the total couple of these the next dinner party at the yes they like hors d'oeuvres in exactly the like taking a blanket who could automate the exhibit was there like a cocktail weenies in that particular barbecue kitchen mixture in that stuff if thou them more junk I've got one for you were talking about 10 accidental inventions and i.e. I know we talked about this a lot but I think it bears repeating the accidental discovery of LSD S yeah probably one of the funniest things that ever happened a chemist ever ship Albion LB Hoffman back in the late 1929 started working at Sandoz pharmaceuticals in Switzerland and he decided his gig at the bottom of air got and Erika is that it's a mold that believer fungus am sorry that euros on our eye in particular and has long been known to like make people do crazy weird stuff that maybe the Salem witch trials were the result of ergot poisoning teacher or the Enlightenment as a result of was possible always a quote unquote poisoned right there got craziness and LB Hoffman is trying to him the feeling of the issues that he can look it up he was trying to figure out you know what you can do with this is been studying for Lonnie came up with the lysergic acid that thalidomide and he made that several attempts at it in on his derivative LST 25 he got got some honest hands I guess just that it somehow ill fingertips so he he he has it on his fingers and he goes on to lay down his 13] golden colors in a kaleidoscope and the I ate interested him I guess you could say sure they started researching heavily like injecting it getting buy credits from his assistant knowledge stuff they took on per each a gun accident in the three days later he is like this should try that for real and then he got a ride home on a bike from his assistant in April 16 is now referred to as bicycle day you about those hippies and not one of his quotes that I thought was really great when he first described that he said it was quote a not unpleasant intoxicated like state you that was on the first time apparently by the bicycle trip devil. Oh really but then the heat that's it that way than to the ways of not unpleasant once again at my server and Capt. so it's yet it was an accidental discovery of the nature of the psychedelic nature and he said we should start using the stuffer like medicine that all the hippies had other ideas yesterday he ultimately referred to LSD as his problem child he wrote a book called my problem child in 1980 at think it was, those ones are figure my problem child come here here's some money you are the 1980 and beliefs that boy and realizing that the theatrical dishes in a old guy climbing he he drank a tablespoon of LSD every day for successful given his longevity I think so that's number one right are that sexy number 10 that is the intro well accounts I don't think it's account CNN women an extra now just make it up as it apparently is loaded it Josh number nine cornflakes is fictionalized in the TC Boyle book the road well though was it a TC Boyle that book you to know that there is great 11 at the city movie yes I I've not seen the movie or read the book yeah Matthew Broderick guided Hopkins is good and the Battle Creek before they really have and that's the home of cereals right Kellogg's is basically Kellogg's cereal here we get Wilkie Kellogg he was interested medicine and he was working as a doctor of the Battle Creek sanitarium with his brother help an amount within this is in the Marina like with her diet to transfer to weird treat animals being on a monthly huge honor he also am discovered Erb created the first acidophilus soymilk oh really you and to meet alternative that ultimately led something to something like American tofu or some boiler genius and he is responsible by accident the cornflakes I will was am sorry John Harvey his brother was okay response with those two things flow into the family he was making bread one day at the old sanitarium there in Battle Creek he left of what we sitting out for little too long he came back and he rolled into the dough and it became flaky which is not what he was looking for me was I cannot those in the oven anyway see what happens a big diesel wakes that the patients are likely these are delicious we should pour some milk over the stuff and got a banana into it and not put in the box can we get some freeze-dried strawberries added exactly and eventually he tinkered with it and switch it over to corn is a main ingredients and wheat and that was cornflake) that's how I took off yet with the added her use corn insurers can like this is good but what is the sweeties these are terrible if exactly and any that a try with corn in Maryland, and that formed the Battle Creek toasted cornflakes company which eventually became Kellogg's accidental series again here who whenever he came up with the Battle Creek toasted cornflakes company name if you know rents that that that name just like screens that were spent to those the little white covers that go over your shoes yeah Mr. Monopoly year a catheter salon in a terrible remember of the Panther via Oscar you I thought Spatz might've been the little sock leggings but those are probably discovered cycling practices are called spin such garters or garters are you should bring it back you know now is that out for good reason by moving on it you have any other Kellogg specs I have neither Kellogg's specs nor any more spats jokes about 5&deg; ago one this is dynamite name for the great Greek root meaning connected with our effort Nobel Swedish scientist accidentally discovered dynamite when he was working on basically with nitroglycerin is working on explosives try make it stable's father built minds I was out I started and you built mines using explosives strictly nitroglycerin but back then it was kind of like okay 80 people died because nitroglycerin just exploded, looked at it wrong yet well because we haven't a jar in the back of a horse carpets right that is part of the probably feel but he lost a brother and three other people at his lab in Stockholm when is trying to figure how to stabilize it present but he he kept with it and so in the article it says that he was transporting and saw it packed in this stuff this mud that we like the called keys ogre if Dalmatia's Earth right but I read elsewhere that it was met ultimately he came up with using keys ogre yes I read that he dropped it undecided that's what I really thought is going to die is the wisest vile fault by all night good nitroglycerin fall out of hand but it landed on sawdust was absorbed and he went weird that I started cutting are downloaded admixture with an inert material you you could conceivably blasted by adding a fuse to he finally came up with keys ogre which is like this kind of thick sedimentary mud right yeah it's like it's real powder eats accommodation across fossil crushed fossil and Marine life catching like it's what they use axiom probably see that that's what these on film sets when they want to make stuff with dirty I'll Physicist like super light and powdery and makes it look really super dirty gotcha keylogger the Fullers earth while he also items that would be something he fear how to stabilize nitroglycerin in created a stable explosive chair but he compete combined it with it another previous invention of his based on the initial ignition principle which is not just using abuse but having a fuse kernel blasting cap and having a smaller explosive blow up your bigger explosive yet he put together now is dynamite truly dynamite it was an he again he is doing this to build minds yet in his lifetime Esau's invention used to like destroy human lives yet he he Lula Pallotta thinks himself by accident a lot of his factories&hellip; At one time Shania they basically said you can't do this anymore on the mainland segment started work on a barge you I think the parchment of the one I'm sure everything will is like King Midas but everything exploded that's right by him so at it as part of his legacy he created the Nobel Peace Prize right to why does he bequeath it trick to basically say hey I'd I a lot of people died because of my invention so let's let's promote safety in harmony and peace in the might of the ignorant bells yeah and about full circle they didn't he persuaded no no bells blasting powder that eventually became dynamite not to be confused the TNT different okay to AC/DC was wrong TNT and dynamite is not true I know you're still what they should've that was a TNT I'm not quite dynamite or I am less effective than dynamite that should've been the song so what is seen to GMT is is dynamite a 60% 60% greater energy than TNT while it's while so it's two totally different things it's not dislike a lesser degraded renowned diamond about high explosives meaning they detonate instead of like burning there but him Yep two different things on Scott was using the drink as we all find out really why died because the drink the dude with the hat noticed that's the second guy Brian Johnson the first lead singer the first ever many alms diagnose Kari passed out after night drinking into the old joke on the vomit thing but here's the one assaying TNT dynamite I thought those two guys are like what I thought TNT and dynamite were up its on the Pentagon now finance and came along later with back in black was his first album it's all that a good early AC sponsor would you think about Sammy Hager so saccharine is up next check I filigree toggle a second let's do it while we're just really going down the line here are reacted exit of invention number seven okay well so there is a guy who is named Constantine fall Berg yet he was working his the chemist working in the labs at Johns Hopkins under a guy named Ira Remsen yeah articles Constantine a jerk he does but not quite for the reasons that are displayed here so fall version Remsen are working on apparently substitute for coal tar if so I can come across that line of his quote he's saying like I've made many discoveries must nurture Coltart some of them accidentally here's one but he doesn't say like what I was doing was synthesizing chemicals in the search for substitute for Coltart writes in a Christina Harborside behind it but that's what I think right okay he he said he was in a great hurry and let the lab without washing his hands apparently he was wearing gloves or anything either always working in the lab with these chemicals that he didn't know what they were it anyone home and he ate dinner right and he was eating up piece of bread in his bribes a really sweet and he realizes that was weird so he put the bread done whites is that hands his mouth and his beard with the neck can think the hta feathered after super Sweeney think of something where going on putting together realized it must've been that powder that he had on his hands from that the chemical that is spelled on it they didn't endorse off before he ate with the same exactly an eternity second to residue while he he said occupy makes money off this and I'm out of the impression that he he shut out Remsen so what he did what Remsen was a total research is a total lab rat getting care a thing about patents and he was apparently fine with the idea that faltered when often independently patented until it started making money know until he started telling people that he was the one that created this think he was the senior researcher right then now is screwing with Remsen's like lab rat status&hellip; That's when rents it was like shut your mouth also didn't have as much to do with money now his rep exactly interesting so I am folder ended up with the pattern for second and years and years and years later the 80s happen people all coked out there looking for ways like lose some weight and sweet low comes along that second and has so few calories and apparently 5 cal AEI Graham that it's just listed a 0 cal casinos those packets are a lot less than a gram yeah and the reason why it's non-caloric is because it's never metabolized by the body just goes out the way it in the same form became it yeah zero food energy value it's like if you are trapped freezing in the woods and he had a big bucket a sweet low it wouldn't be the same as of yet a big bucket of sugar you it wanted the bucket sugar checked the north of the big bucket is sugar while food energy trapped in the woods of the big-budget Sigma you're screwed it khaki meds like the fuzzy jackets on your teeth and a bucket of sugar in the woods since it was brought on the scene it's kind of been added and removed quite a few times to the you can eat this it's fine and it's probably not great for you list but right now it's in good stead it is it is the approved the war in the late 80s early 90s like after they've been taking it for while they took like a hard look at Sacra numerical and they cause cancer in lab rats afforded in my unsweetened iced tea I've seen because it's only thing I can find that even put sugar learned six to the bottom or what yet what it will that's why you have these symbols are you or put this sugar in the hot brew tea right now but if it is often I can do that new simple syrups fine works really well district sweetie forgot to add I'm on an uncertainty kick Renaldo Lemmon Nancy L at the sweetie or or if I drink green tea upset us just have you ever had this oolong tea Yasser is something who love the crazy I Josh at into the microwave at a filigree talked about it before like 100 times we have so skip UK Viagra yeah I hadn't heard of this one I didn't realize it was accidental he had heard of Viagra please I've heard above the Viagra yes I have heard of the story behind and I'll got ROI theory or insinuated "Simon Campbell and David Roberts were researching for Pfizer trying to develop some blood pressure and heart medication for angina you and they tested on people doing some trials and these guys raw like still has some angina have a massive erection I which is a weird side effect you might want to look into this yet and that they did and that while this could they dividends in the info was yet late they basically said okay FDA forget everything we said forget the angina where the pet animal nitrate if they were and instead were in agreement to start over to more clinical trials program uses to treat ED and were going to target handsome salt-and-pepper haired man of the surname you like to bathe in bathtubs outdoors next to their partners who are also in bathtubs watching sunrise that is a target market I wasn't yet something that I wonder if it is all the same colleges get a suit by the pharmaceutically company are not all the same they had each one has different covalent bond of a covalent bond while the defendant property some some work for likely for our some work for like two hours some you take every day just in case you happen to run into someone and need to have sex yeah yet but all of him all of them no pre-prison is not funny there don't think it's funny not now of course okay but it was popular sales peaked up thinking 2008 at $1.9 billion now that's alone then since then I receive agarose at first on the scene but it is been chipped away at by its competitors but like you Cialis in the soon Levitra as our medication to keep track of English alleys and finalized yet anyway they I mean that's this was this is for originally for the treatment of angina and work some chair I think that happens quite a bit actually while is all about blood flow so I make sense that it headed that side effect I guess it's all about blood flow and self-confidence pacemaker I thought this one like my eyes started bleeding during this one right we can skip it because as people know when we do our top tens we generally do like six or seven of them relate to drive traffic to the site Velcro this one I had to give a shout out I wanted to Donatella rebutted this is so amazing so I first heard the story of Velcro when I was just a young young pup the story Velcro if you're where the real story yet okay not been fake NASA story no not the NASA story the George to mistrial the story he was a swish swish some remember what he was but he tended to be a Swiss inventor clutch going to be okay and he was hiking the Alps with his dog when they came home and their burrs entices dog and he said that it's ghastly he said what what what was going on here where these burrs attached to my dog Armand take a closer look any relies of the bears were composed of little Fuchs and that his dog were acting as little loops in and the hooks when in the loops and stuck in attached and he said I can re-create this you know are currently created with nylon and that's what he did and that's all Velcro is is the system of hooks and loops made of nylon now I first learned that story when I was probably like seriously 11 or 12, and I read it in uncle John's bathroom reader Every Christmas I would get an bathroom reader and ever every like December 29 I be done with like the 500 page bathroom reader on some way another yet yeah like a lot just for this reason I would be reading this this book like over and over like disconsolate and soap like one of the reasons they were here today when the redesign here today is because my curiosity was developed and honed through uncle John's bathroom reader I yes and it's been good and bad like they were they were also where I learned thinking is consequently killed at one point 7,000,001 hour which can lead to that article and all that cool but my eyes were open always shouted out to them like recently and they tweeted that we shouted out to him and I realize that they listen to this podcast while settle legal dates like the highest honor I I I have ever enjoyed as far as that my career goes lets us of those it like this group that like made me imparted March part lion the day as a fan of what were doing that's awesome I imagine Mad Magazine could only come closer they got touch with you there definitely is also okay so that's Velcro yet in them couple more little factoids its combination of two French words the lore's genes velvet and crochet which is hooked the bowler does not breathe very well-established right eye nylons renew the times I get a hard time with it and this is a lesson Friday kids up there who fashion resources for paint yourself skews me as a London tours don't give up it took him 10 years from the moment he discovered what Velcro could be till the time that he could manufactured successfully and he worked and he worked any work in 10 years later he marketed it as the zippo sipper the rest is history don't get you poker digital difference I'll manually can't things cheap to take yet you really get much but yeah that stuff onto the deck that you don't want dictate that doesn't have the threads clearly visible yet set form like kind of via almost the rebar of it is exactly what if you can't if you can't see it clearly like in the Rowlands is keep on movement lullabies for me I could judge but that stick to it advice yet not good duct tape stick to the the decade parents those gigabytes per decade of work pencil yeah this was I don't think I realized themselves an accident Alexander Fleming use a bacteriologist in Scotland he decided to little lazy and on vacation for two weeks luckily for us in 1928 can come some seizes a petri dish with the weird moles that he hadn't seen before going in it a notice like there's no bacteria around small items like hugging the side of the battery dislike getting away from me, how this stuff is killing me while I might be on something you're right with Apollo was the strain of penicillin mold that he discovered he left his window open the guy was about SLI neurologist in the 20th century because page left his window open anyway am that the mold the strain he found was on he couldn't reproduce it mass quantities arrive for by definition it was useless is medicine chair and only 13 years later a trio of guys for a helium Moyer found a strain of penicillin that they could just grow very quickly in large amounts damn antibiotics nice millions and millions possibly billion lives safe the great don't take too much of it now and I think a private is they should always know your limits yet now under saying back that I think penicillins wanted a status people get to someone and amoxicillin like for everything these days that will be other part of the problem supposedly is that they E if you don't finish your course that makes it that much easier for him exterior yeah that's what I hear microbes to evolve immunity and I almost never finish my course though because any part of the problem gives me bad bad bad diarrhea you need to ride it out as they say give yourself an uncle John's bathroom reader in fact when I'm on penicillin for one reason or another I called and diarrhea bills I have to take my diary bill because I take it and and they say you know that's a possible side effect of course with me it's a certain side effect at least you don't get Priapus from are it number one Josh unless one I thought this is pretty interesting because going back all the way to the 1800s least to think deeper all stuffy did not have a good time all the did was just go to school go to church walk to work and study hard turns out that they were having laughing gas parties in either frolics either frolics with a would sit around and suck on laughing gas and just laugh the night away which is where the phrase it's a gas comes from oh it's nice image sensor your big-time in entomology I and into Moffat to you that so what happened was anesthesia was accidentally discovered by seems like a few different people realized about the same time from those parties yet Crawford long he's been it when I got right get he said somewhere around Atlanta yet we Morton and Charles Jackson and Horace Wells they had all experiment experiment with nitrous oxide maybe maybe not went to some of these parties can verify that I I have seen that they were at this point I went back in time and looked in the recognition at some point someone said hey select my leg or hard and it didn't hurt at all it is bleeding yet and there was no pain experience, and that because Crawford Long that was likely mean you're not expecting any pain do it again yet empty limit hold your ether from an exactly and then they they started experimenting with it and I think course wells use different dentistry and coffee long as using it for surgery yet for minor surgery copper long like amputations of like that because this is a time when it was like here's your broomstick yes your bottle of whiskey right now not your leg and like the a skilled surgeon was quick that was the that was the definition of skilled surgeon to me particularly often less than a minute what I think what you do your best case scenarios Eagle pass out from the pain right but they also loaded you up on like booze and drugs leisure smoke a lot of opium first or take a lot of opium somehow) say you just wouldn't really care got have you heard about a flesh eating bacteria is going yeah it's craziness very sad that I watch it out with the Nettie Potts stated yeah I actually have invented a little while I dismembered distilled water in a movie boil it already in more boil it anyway you well the very least I do like camping and fishing and rivers on my get in and with any open sore times no but that that girl in Georgia she wanted to find she fell and created an open sore area wound as I got in there pretty good apparently yet Emily nubbin opponents were closely that slight feel satisfied ever yet but she's got a great attitude apparently about oh really yeah like she would mean our dad went and said you know finally totally empty hands your other foot after leg was Artie gone she was like this do it so you may spend time medicine she didn't seem like they just got her fingers that are hands are intact right now except it are her hands gone in Excel while dancers and son in it on strange twist than half what we wanted more accidental inventions and I you do without Sam now there's a few more go the website and read all about yeah type accidental inventions in the search bar@howstuffworks.com and it will bring up this fine article is actually a few articles that I have similar one for different ones to you this remind you up at the search bar@HouseofLordsofLords.com began which means time for listener mail actually wait we can't do with civilian this again you okay plug-fest time gets right so I checked we have a horror fiction contest going on deli that's right real quick given the broad strip well if you're familiar with our Halloween episodes the past two years we do readings right from home at last year in the what's his face the year before that HP love effective plug router in this year we want to read a story written by you someone out there so we are throwing contest and Josh wrote a great blog post outlining the details yet you can find a house of works you can go to blog the house stuff works and it's called on this stuff you should knows for fiction contest get your official rules right here you get everything you need to know everything was a highlight while the highlights are that it started on June 18 and it runs until July 20 at 11:59 PM You it has to have been previously unpublished writer whose websites if you put it up on your blog I think it's okay yet but I give you gave some really posted sorry you and it needs to be between 3000 and 4000 words the more no less And this is really really really really important your statement in the email that you send this in IE Senate by the way to how stuff works_contests@discovery.com event in that email when you enter your submission you need to write the words by entering this contest I agree to abide by the contest rules okay without that it's you have to disqualify so that's basically your signing off that you understand the rules by fight acknowledgments the right of you go to the blogs in read the rules first take a quick glance out of this if you have question is probably answered yeah and sadly we know and we understand that is only for residency United States they are sorry but that's just how it goes of 7 million times we can't win your countries contest either right is just a contest work yes it are the contest gods if if you're 17 yeah even if you're going to turn 18 within the contest your lucky it may be 18 as of Monday, July 13 19 people really don't but were not make enough that I haven't yet though I send it off Austin maybe a couple of other writers or editors will judge you think you select the top 16 and impairment of bracket contest then let the people vote and we take that and the winner is chosen and we read it on our angle you write what else were going to comic con San Diego you for the first time ever yeah and Thursday we don't have the time yet but Thursday July the well we will be doing a live podcast panel you special guest yeah what a redundant arguments that you give this was given express for now so, contrary to be there come see us Thursday afternoon I think right yet you will find out will post it once we can reveal all the foothills very cool so I they feel that slugfest is now senseless from our Josh and I call this what medical medical marijuana and by the way on email I been entering more and more lately you have more time but still if you write in and I don't answer your credit promise and if you sent in a simple suggestion for show we log the but you may not get the number is going to feel that they you are a valued member of medical marijuana your show on him in J is what some people in on the it reminded me of a funny story I can share a during the early 80s my father had a rare cancer it's even rare these days from the surprise my doctors have when I get my medical history one point my dad's doctor suggested he try marijuana to help with the chemo six I'm of course it was no way prescribe it back then unit on your own I'm appear start asking around to see his kids could get some trustworthy stuff with no luck where we live my mom turned to a relative Lieut. other state that really like the stoner cousin microsystem she could get it but I don't know the details how the best yet the next problem was how to get to us and she often flew to visit every few months was afraid of putting it in her luggage or mailing it if not everybody that you so one of her coworkers had an idea they worked in a doctor's office and decided hide it between her breasts in bandage her if you should read recently had breast surgery he was sent with a note saying under no sent by circumstances with appendages to thought that if she was hassled airport a note would get her out of trouble did this actually if you time to never got caught only gone down the crazy as it turns out my father couldn't smoke to stuff it made him sick or oh my God and so he decided to brew in T and I'm sure there was a little take snack but in this lunch bag every now I'm enforcing my father passed away before now 16 I wasn't completely involved in all this other stuff the story for retold later there a lot of hijinks going on this year's so this is totally plausible I remember vividly the little T-ball sitting in St. when I wash the dishes every night asking likely missing get a resounding no for about five people in the house seemed so that is from Cindy and the she's inebriated Dennis anyway but she*read this and she said yes and she will fax said United up talking my mom about this elegant lap all over again you remember my father she said her mom is smoking some for her anxiety so is probably wipe your hard drive clean of that email with somebody sure that they yes you heavily go wacky family history story is there off the wheel that is pretty wacky government you like Little Miss sunshine wacky and it is the we won here so I tweaked to assess Lacey podcasts.com's list of the snow email and stuff podcast discovery for more on this and thousands of other Works.com brought to you by the reinvented 2012 Camry it's ready you</p>
