Wasn't so easy for him to get his hands on a prison but he get then he shut his blinds with the runners hold legal people the little hole in one of the block and then he waited the sun had to be at just the right angle anyway and when the sun got to just the right spot Ray of light shot willhis life in the clean a rainbow on the other words college in the sun gorgeous is encoded in the this attorney thin lease your book about color and she says the thing to understand about this experiment at the time people believe that white light was given by God or given given by this amazing single nature the light from the sun was sort of holy if there was anything it was pure it was white so when the prison to the rainbow thing with people new prisons did they just figure the colors are in there in the glass in other words that rainbow had nothing to do with the light itself that was just the prison adding some kind of impurities to the life all while I hadn't thought of the possibility of the prison is muddying the lightest you like what had he known the prism isn't generating these colors so he got a second prism and this was the trick while the first prison was still making that Raybon will a few feet away and held a second prison in the blue area to see what would happen to the blue light with the prison had more colors to the blue light or would it be transformed in some other way and what he found well nothing happens it remains blue 2.if the blue light isn't getting money back to prison and maybe the prison wasn't muddying the white light to begin with name rainbow of colors without succumbing from inside the white light he inferred that the first prison is dividing light into its constituent parts we can get the white light we see around us if I should constitute over these comments colors were in the light they are my yet his answer right is a physical thing in the physical world tweaking Study this is the beginning of everything we know about light today Newton put us on the road toward finding that ultraviolet rays x-rays radio waves are all different energies of light colors are just energies within that little sliver that we can see in his led to our understanding of the greenhouse effect knowing what*you even the age of our own not everybody was pleased.  Of information junkie in romantic is ready crust and in and in Napoleon's regime leverage is removed to the poetry of the romance and the real challenge to Newton's view of color when I would really stick out enough it did come from poet not Keats but at the poet in Goethe's German Romantic poet that is author Jon Allaire Regulus who writes about this kind of thing always wonderfully one-day he is walking in the park and he spots these yellow crocuses and he looks at the eloquent as Myers to handle the early spring and implement many quickly turns away in an instant he suddenly sees – of violent crosses eyes he still sees the shape of the flower but now it's violent it's the opposite of yellow he had rubbed his eyes against the needle in it and yet there it was just as real as eloquently he wasn't really came from inside his mind and analysts note something you involve the student color you can press on your eyeball a close rise this writer fireworks but forgot to that simple observation between to think they may be color isn't simply about the extra University maybe our perception of colors began in the world but maybe was finished inside the mind and today hundreds of years later this is still an open question a scientist can say color has an objective reality but the colors we see our tricks of the imagination and there is no perfectly objective view of color are personally I like to both of those opinions in mind the same time the 23 Lucky for us we can do a whole shallowness in the eye and yet I will try Robert… Radio Lab and today it's all about color yes where is color it in now that's the question yet written elsewhere that question through the eyes of butterfly in the killing fields of Cambodia with a woman may see colors the rest of us can only dream and will go back to a time when the see of parenting look like dark red wine sticks you held out to get color him and by the way for your willingness to say we did something different for us out while making this out put out the call to a bunch of musicians solo artist and to send us their favorite colors on their own interpretations the favorite color son and I got an amazing responsive throughout this hour your color signs of various kinds woven into the pieces between pieces those songs by the way we have plans a glance that are website Radio Lab.org get a full list the songs and thank you by the way of nuisances okay so I should doubt yes let's guess so to to get things going here.  Not long after the glycogen click about Sir Isaac Newton week to a neuroscientist by the end of Mark Changi on the two great authority who it written a book about color judgments on event and we threw the question is so one of the to the debates that beginners to us is this where is the color is it out there muses great family right now is it red for everything and be a whale into any or is it does it exist in a in a way that you depend on states outside me or does it only get to be red when it gets in my head well it you can another what a more severe way to chassis last visit when I rub to the talks as this would aliens see it is read yet would would alien seed is read by an aunt and answers almost surely know through this is Mark even your dog wouldn't see it is read out your dog has television has blue yellow and like white yes so what would the world look like to dog if you've ever known a guy who's colorblind in 10% of men are colorblind that's roughly what it's like the question is the dog and the human and a crow were to be steering in a rainbow would they be seeing very different things yes I know this question that Robert is can a tossed out during interviews like about how different creatures and see the rainbow this in a taken as the little wormhole we ended up executing a choir to help us illustrate what we learned but just set a baseline your normal rainbow goes like this starting bottom red orange yellow-green pilot release event you have not highlighted with the idea presented we didn't have the integral you couldn't say it will be would you that's why you need VI is to say the adjective that mightily is Tom Cronin was going to visual ecologist Mark suggest we get McAuley told us that UNC seven colors in the rainbow and in the case of the dog very different it's been a start off Louisville St. Louis fine so it was a rainbow starting with blue St. Louis CNN grading off into green and save you and then disappearing in Domingo and their between video thrown that's it guess other immobility about half as thick as ours Sasaki rainbow dog yet that's why when God promised that he would never deliver another dailies and he gave up a parent made the comments in a rainbow the dogs just for totally unimpressed in what is it about the.I that makes it see this one doesn't have read sensitive photoreceptors no red sensitive cones the weird thing is that the difference between dogs and us come wise is just one they had codes to do blue and green so we we had this one extra read really seem like a big difference means just one called my three is so much better than to next Jane Knight's vision scientist because of this kind of multiplicative thing read and get mixed with blue check purple or red yellow orange Keeler turquoise 100 different shades of color so by adding when photo pigment instead of adding just one works fully actually add about 98 colors yourself but let's move on so now we have a crow question that to change record while the crow is not something as a treatment like us after let's take a listen cause something like a sparrow I is Barrows of ultraviolet vision what do they see so they see it as a rainbow starts before are in the start but we do see sky would see ultraviolet color then I would see the violent many oranges the rate of probably would see further into the red because they have a more red sensitive with receptor as a much broader range of start earlier and later should we assume that we now that this bow is the champion but that's the that's that's his eyes get if you're talking about vertebrates anything that has a heart and the mind and have been allegedly the vertebrates then all bets are off you got many animals have much better color vision in the vertebrate story neglect butterflies are reasonable butterflies have five or six kinds of race of color receptors we only have three remember butterflies see more colors than we do Ya so if a butterfly were looking at you exit with you I'm sure you butterflies are out there and when nonliving Missouri but was the colors we had no names for between the blues and greens and the greens and yellows so they would go from ultraviolet would see that you and Violet blue and blue blue-green Green dream legally and whatever right pointed with a a very complicated okay so just to recap here's the dog and use us humans now the sparrow the more basic movement were high-end to speak and finally the butterfly him which is not so far above the spirits Were made to

new juice but it's fun for them to get out of their cage in the talk to their friends event the day to until one morning after about 20 weeks J woke up the monkeys even the test and they began to not fail me if you watch the video this is actually looks like the monkeys like you know I'm not having any failures and check out this thanks figured out I did get some sense that they felt like that their life and improve a now if this works alone the monkeys can you take colorblind human and defend back there is absolutely we could sure colorblindness in human with exactly this technique recently the only thing that we have to do is convince the FDA that the risks are low enough in the benefit is high enough that it beat something we can do when people have a unified in their know we've never tried although I get a lot of emails that say I don't care what the risks are I've even had offers pump out if I come to laboratory and you don't tell anybody late at night and you give it a shot and I and we won't tell you which brings us back to our original question if you take a colorblind human and give them normal color vision could you take a normal color seer and boost to make little more sent well yeah yeah picture when I the next all FTA but here's the real surprise it says there are some people who already a little bit mantis shrimp like there are colored mutants; that in the nicest possible way among us or there out there and hear the case here's the deal the genes for the colons in our eyes see color in the red Queen glucose sniff there on the X chromosome no man as we know me have one of this women have 2X chromosomes which means that women have to sets of these: making genes normally one seditious spare it's not used it got to set and so someone said a hot it is theoretically possible and some women this bears the genes might mix up turn on morph into a whole new: 84th: broken a call at the yellow cone self people with normal color vision are trying chromatic got three cones a woman like that would be Patrick Matt so altogether should have a blue cone a green, a yellow card in red, which you would just see more yellow this new yellow wood mixed with the red in the blue and then green.  Creek houses many millions more shape this amazing Technicolor is not the right word it's whatever would be the next better color that would be even more superduper this is just a thought experiment yeah but J actually figured out a way to test we can look at people's blood and I can say this woman has the genes from blue: screen const yellow cones bedrooms you can do a DNA test yeah so starting blood tests he found this 11 she worked at same place we did crazily enough at the University looks pretty in a soft gene for the fourth, to did she see in super Technicolor how juvenile that was that was a problem and so we thought of an experiment in order to be able to see whether not she had this extra dimension of color using the deceased to yellow lights to us in trichromatic normal decrements look totally identical work colorblind to that difference but to a catcher, a woman with the sports: they look totally different so they brought her in paste said okay here it is to see these is different when she sat now I don't see them this is any different but the story doesn't end there good as gentle as a colleague of his in England that she's at Newcastle named Gabrielle Jordan and she barely found eight of these women with the extra count and out of those 87 of those women behave exactly like the person that I attest couldn't see the difference but one of them took one look at those two yellows and said no they look totally different to me one of these women with saw the salt size difference one of them had the cone could use it and the others had become the couldn't use it yeah so why is that in well this is the part if you'd like I could tell you what my theory is what's going yeah so I think it adjacent as let's just imagine you grow up in a world without completely and totally black and white world houses with thinking black-and-white printers would all be printed in black and white even the TV it would just have black and white women's makeup would be just ketone the dark light so it wouldn't make any difference if you have television because he would never use that television there be no words for color now just to make interesting let's imagine one day deep right rated Apple pops into your how would you react to it would you think well so that's a very good question maybe says J you have the ability to see that red apple if you've never had a chance to use that ability to practice it may just lay dormant and back he thinks might be what happens to women living with the extra: in our there very rarely subjected to colors that would stimulate their extra kind of clown differently to sing this other colleges aren't around enough for them everything that we make is based on the fact that humans are trichromatic television only has three colors are color printers have three different colors there's nothing out there that we make artificially that Patrick Mac could see a J says maybe some women because they're just more aware are because of the job that they do maybe someone who works with color all the time like a florist or pain or little by little disappearing such close attention their brain would learn so naturally we would find one of these mythic we are not mythic maybe resisted as he tried to find that one woman that he mentioned in the 108 and we had a really hard time indicated that even existed and it would begin to look online and you see all these websites think are you attentive, contact us contact us Emily is searching for these women and we can feel good chasing unicorns loathing in our producer Tim Howard Slaney claimed he found me that you are in keep in touch the JJ told him that he tested woman determined she had the fourth Cohen and this one with an interior design but Jay had not yet turned with it she could use her fourth counsel we sent 10 Pittsburgh where she lives in I is in the night air three and an interior designer Lucy like she's great at you a jukebox play something about number 307 it's a seems appropriate that the color lighter shade she told me a lot about how she uses color in her work in different colors USC things a lot about in terms of being walls away it is oriented in a written east wall of different colors in any case here is my plan I'd ordered this test before went to Pittsburgh the Jade suggests I get I don't involve these little pieces of brown fabric okay they all look identical they were strikingly the same to me yeah Lynn Brenner needs soaring completely as you couldn't see them all at the same to you but assuming there ask you not think that the directors said if you show them to a real tetra, 30 be able to see these subtle differences that you know you and I can't see him then back to Pittsburgh will retire that she is inevitably much more fun and we ended up doing the test in the nearby park.

the first row took out three of the swatches to that were exactly the same one that was supposedly different and we took it out could you see the difference no now so I go behind the tree and I whisper into the mic three I hope you can hear me let you take a look she steps backwards gives a look for a moment and then she said numbers.  Third one is different with some are neutral last rad new one entailing the last one for one luck so I went behind the tree I second seems up the swatches so that now the middle swatch with the outward and scenes seem to yield very sick which numbers look different in the you are right in the while okay then I figured I got to make it harder I switch it up and I'm using all three are different and I didn't tell three offering different clean rag let's rants and finally knocking it out of the park is well-nigh at the eighth him you found her I died I was sure is easy that she was not good of the there's no way this testing work well it actually might not have totally work Layla did she start to fail there is one little thing that in the I brought along a friend Jason Lacroix painter landscape still life thought I try them out as a control you think in this gets owned likes color but as a boy and can't be better, right so and when we tried the exact same tests with him Mimi three Philip don't they to you now I see different view was amazing every time the first one on the left you jumped out immediately number one they all free will Ramsey just as good as Susan yeah I was a little bit disappointed faces and was nowhere where he couldn't do it and she could know me I only had pieces of brown cloth and you know that doesn't prove anything against GC etc., right for all I know and there was this one moment I'd know doesn't prove anything back I asked her pastor about sky and the sky was just that quintessential sky-blue and she is what ECGs like Aion the manipulative live a lot of pain like among the blend there is red in applet she was looking at the blue sky is red yeah that he say that no I think I like you ran like in is good about Mrs. Kenneth a perfect sky blue and and I'd like to read it is next in their Lenny I don't see any green Apple's identity rants right especially around like-minded at that moment I felt like my skies boring so sorry for you from Niagara and any destination in mine is there a in as an they and as

Ron I am Robert Krulwich Mrs. Radio Lab Pentagon and echelon colors now with a story about well the color the sky was beautiful: Bill off etc. read that story finally surprising facing a construct researching how I guess the who heard it from give the essence of his guys so guy du jour is a linguist and a writer and that I came across his book through the language they tell this one particular story in it that I starts and I think 1858 with this guy William Gladstone who this incredibly famous politician in England he was four times Prime Minister in the second half of the 19 centuries every school kid knows who he is even now but there is one thing that not many people know about that stuff when he was at home affinity as the soldiers marched the gleam went dazzling from the magnificent bronze all about the other and he was of a deeply religious man and for him there is an enormously long as I can by shipping the black blood called shaved pussy and cried out-over and over again throughout design so he was in the home that's so early on in his career Gladstone decided to write the definitive history of Homer's huge book XE three books thousands of pages way discussed the whole range of issues relating to home in his left and here's the thing as he was reading during his research everything she made this very strange discovery that's the way home it talks about contacting the head in the Odyssey is extremely on it's odd very very onto herself to start three uses extremely strange tens full kinds of simple objects and most famous one passes the wine dark see the wind wind art
.cc to one looks like why it is a possibly like a poetic kind of thing that's what you would naturally think that the editing equals and wind, oxen but but is more than just a wine dig color violet which to me and probably the purple purple when Homer uses it it looks like the sheep the Cyclops were in the cycle case is having a dark violet will this is fantasy.  But the other thing that he also says is violet is iron I so as you are not, this one what is both the color of honey and the color of faces pale with fear I know I'd yes, those are greetings greetings for me he didn't put his forest green he didn't quote these leaves green and it all seems to be wrong and him this was totally puzzling to Gladstone hobo was just an absolute hero so he found it difficult to understand except why someone who is so effective would use such defective times is that quite so he starts going through the Iliad and the Odyssey Page by page recounts how many times each color peers becoming times use the word black blue yet and am it only takes a couple pages for the notice is predominance of black and white that the term black and carrying Florida is probably like black occurred about 170 times both books white light of white love the white sailing curd about 100 white bread of blood red suit only clocks in at about 13 times red wine to itself to yellow dorm in her yellow rope under 10 times green teeth chattering Greenfield also under 10 and then Gladstone realizes something crazy the color blue zero times when there's just no way next describes the kind of do in any of home's poems he does not use the word blue all mildew no blue night and once note so glad some thought the bazaar and he started looking in other classic Greek text to and there he kept finding all of these strange uses of color 5/2 excitement in after thing about this for a long time Jackson concluded the Homo was kind of behind but also that all of the Greeks what kind of the but she thought all of them were colorblind yet that they sold the weld in black and white maybe with a touch of rate his thought was that they were straining to see these other colors that were kind of just outside of their reach and then their kid would inherit that effort or the kid would just be a little bit better as that's how we got color so Homer Junior would be able to see a little bitty yellow consumer tried really hard to see a login and homer the third would be better than home in second and then this would happen again and again every generation down 3000 years to the present day need to seem the only in achieving only possible explanation that screen did since ridiculous we know today of course setting that mediate.com vision goes back probably but that the meaning yet you know it's like when we're still in the jungle country exactly fell and generally people mocked him
to conspiracy to the people explain the new blue and Homer think well here's the plot 10 years after Gladstone's homered debacle his other guy in German Jewish theology: nothing was gigantic lazar's guide a German Jewish what philologist which I thought was a linguist it basically means you studies in ancient text he finds pretty much the same kind of weird stuff the Gladstone did but he finds it not just an aging Greek texts but all over the place.

you come in three languages yet so you did this massive analysis to trace when each color term was first introduced to language and what he found was the only jacket which languages seem to client these content is not hereunder first black-and-white every language has black and white then when they get their first color term grade always comes fast always are it off the rent is only piano really yeah and then green and do only the very end so black-and-white red green yellow and blue And it's universal well as people discovered more more languages they found some exceptions the couple things held even from Geiger out of the colors red is always first in blue is always last one well allowing to be in order it all and why would blue always be last as we get to the guessing part okay I think some I have to do with a couple of things first in Homer's world you would've actually been exposed to a lot of blue things actually refuting elected new is extremely ratty nature blue foods now you animals how plants as if you view blue plant like what I now is it I really do I extremely read a lot of flowers that we think of is blue there actually deficient salad we made them blue genetically yet when a blue life UIs at the time way in short supply and among the Greeks but here's really get the guys main point he said he don't really need a word for color until you can make that color reliably and the reason that read might've been first is that red is apparently one of the easiest to produce you can just think a dry piece of red clay can use that as a current which is why paints made out of poker go back something like 60,000 years in blue blue is a hardest of all for thousands of years no one had one exception the Egyptians agent and they and only they had their own word for blue so that's it that's your answer you like to talk no blue dyes no blue words that's not interesting I want more than that what would he mean more something more to say just about I reader is calling around I ran into something that made me think a little differently about Gladstone's whole theory of color blindness call this guy named Jules Davitt off professor neuropsychology lung University and fears back he got interested in this particular tribe in the media called the him by not many languages well they don't have a different way to do you might think of them is like a very poor stand-in from our enemy glossary short does want to Namibia he said I'm of the bunch of members of the him the tribe without a laptop and show them 12 colored squares or identical except for one in the sexism really cool video footage of his research assistant doing this and asked them there simply which one is different now you look at this any still 11 of the squares are green accounting we would go great very great the other one is blue this blue on its it's shouting it's like 80 it's easy enough for us to do the no-brainer but the him but who don't have a separate word for Bloom in the language like they find that this distinction is it a difficult when they start this screen they just air stair the see the difference daily now lesser something wrong with her I liked it need not compete using that in the Dempsey, individual, is different but then way is so easy to say that this seeing different colors to us and then not within how does he explain I can when we decide to put countless together in a group and then give those colors a word like blue something he says what happens then how does a category for that thing thing in the category jumps out and gets louder and louder to your eyes the category actually feeds back on your perception you notice you saying that having the word for blue unlocks your ability is seedless and mean it that's how it feels to me and Joel says that it's not, he says without the word you're still seeing the blue no matter what you just not noticing your either is coming glossing right over it so you don't see it is a heart fits it's it's harder to spot sister whatever I don't plan to do that differently would not jump out and say hi five the way it does with us but if he doesn't jump out to that extent then this is starting to sound very Gladstone communicated that we need little right like as if Homer had no word for blue in the word somehow enables the blueness of the blue and maybe his world was less blue then it would be for us mean maybe blue went through his eyes in the same way but perhaps didn't get into his mind in the same way in a blue didn't matter Lisa Hewitt's breaks down where the sky… Have you looked on as the bluest blue in the world is right there but I had been there since the dawn of time so why wouldn't blue matter more me why wouldn't be the first color study the last but so I thought to ask I got that Eliza sky-blue is is that the first question you that you are connected either effect questionable to the enough you but I wanted to see how obvious both striking his duties of the skies that I decide to make an experiment I has a very young but 18 he was letting to speak but what's her name am I took the launch of a color with him and told to all the colors including do we would pay always gainsaid that that they were that children you know pointing out objects I was pointed to do object in basket with the kind of exudes a buffa blue jackets soon enough him was a total approach could identify any color show me the red object communities and right near anything I didn't do and I asked my wife not to do was and had mentioned that the sky was that was sent so one day Dynamo or take a stroll and they're practicing the colors with history was this what's this and I pointed at the sky instead what kind I stopped and she would give me any onset the but that she just a second befall what was happily telling me that something was doing regularly to just look And you give me in comprehending a so there was a talking about you that forgetting I think she didn't understand what Amazon about in retrospect it was no object that there was nothing with cut for your just pointing into the void is pointing into nothingness so she wouldn't say anything but I kept asking every single time they went for sanity anyone the sky was blue and she would never answer in this one on for two months and finally he didn't consent to give me kind anybody wasn't village was wiped out for a few times he said white and then finally after month and a half with two moments she said boo for the fast time why then it wasn't consistent to do so she then she said let's do no white mildew that she eventually decide the not that it is blue where nursing an essay this way but eventually when I asked it became consistently been so she just would save the okay this was for me reason point why I could never convince myself to convince it is my hot this is allegedly passing example do and is not so perfect so we know for home and we know never ever probably thought the object except the sky in this he never had that dad two went on about the objects and asking what the kind of the sky was the fact that he didn't lose sleep over it doesn't seem so strange anymore outcome of its now that I heard this on the little I'm a little of ruling that the moment when Alma decided the sky was blue letter half whatever she wants to be that has to be below weirdly then color is a loss of innocence yet garlic having something fix that for a while it's just between you in your frenzied hearts noticed his guys many colors truthfully the other hand now disagreement myself now if we all agree disguise blue than that something we can share she can share and then she's in conversation and eventually shall understand this kind is there anyone but but there but you know what one would know it feels like.
