It's the Ted radio hour from NPR and I rise in her show today transformation stories and ideas about becoming a completely different person rejecting everything you know everything you are taught to believe and starting over when you think that your life and that of your life do you think of it as a transformation that you gave yourself a second chance to have a completely different like wow that's a very difficult question this is exactly bringing I certainly and I guess I would use the term transformation somewhere in very different in my beliefs then I was when I was I mean even 10 years ago and really you could say his transformation began more than 20 years ago one November night in 1990 taking regime told that story on the head stage for November 5, 1990 men Indocin the center walk into a hotel in Manhattan and assassinated Rabbi Mark on the leader of the Jewish Defense league Lucero was initially found not guilty of murder but while serving time on lesser charges he and other men began planning attacks on a dozen New York City landmarks including tunnels synagogues and United Nations headquarters thankfully those plans were foiled by an FBI informant sadly the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center was not Lucero would eventually be convicted for his involvement in the plot a saving of Sarah's my father safety regime was just seven years old at the time was too young to know that his dad was a member of a jihadist cell eventually he get life in prison I know you are really young and you can remember asking where do I did I was told that that he had been injured and that he was in the hospital recuperating and the next thing I know we are writing in our station wagon to Rikers Island to visit him for the first time you know my mother told me get in the car going see her father so I did it out of prison guards told me to open my mouth to check inside to see about finding any and all razors or something just an ounce, went with it is basically accepted what a lot of his dad's friends told that his father was a hero I had one man who every time he saw me to give me $100 bill apparently from my father Don actually bought my first Game Boy with hundred dollar bill that this kind didn't today 25 years later Jackie Raheem is a peace activist but he got there but require attentive rebirth it was very slow process to longtime I had to kind of reevaluate the way I saw my father and his belief system and so I had to basically realized that that my father was an extremist and that he was willing to take in some people's lives for his cause to realize that to experience kind of transformation meant he had to make a choice the choice to change I was born in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania in 1983 to him and Egyptian engineer and all loving American mother in grade school teacher who together try their best to create a happy childhood for me it wasn't until I was seven years old that our family dynamics started to change my father exposed me to a side of Islam that few people including the majority of Muslims get to see a few months prior to his arrest he sat me down and explain that for the past few weekends he and some friends having going to a shooting range on Long Island for target practice he told me undergoing within the next morning we arrived the Calverton shooting range which unbeknownst or group was being watched by the FBI when it was my turn to shoot my father help me hold the rifle to my shoulder and explained how to aim at the target about 30 yards off that day the last bullet I shot hit small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone's surprise especially mine the entire target burst into flames my uncle turned to the other men and in Arabic said if novel like father like son they thought they saw me the same destruction my father was those men would eventually be convicted of placing a van filled with 1500 pounds of explosives into the sump level parking lot of the World Trade Center's north tower causing an explosion that killed six people and injured 1000 others these were the men I looked up to these with a maniacal Dom which means on by the time I turned 19 I had already moved 20 times in my life that instability during my childhood generally provide an opportunity to make many friends being a perpetual new face in class I was frequently the target of bullies so for the most part I spent my time at home reading books watching TV or playing video games a growing up in a bigoted household I wasn't prepared for the real world I've been raised to judge people based on arbitrary measurements like a person's race or religion he would just talk about Jews being evil and I would hear similar things from you know from the men that that were with him the key people being evil and them wanting to turn you gave some of you would go to hell to interest them being ghetto all-around terrible people in a bad influence in and he used to say things like a bad Muslim is better than a good non-Muslim deliver a member you know*feeling that way to yeah I mean that's that's pretty much what indoctrination is he now you have authority figures around you telling you that the world is one way and you don't get to see another perspective you know that the people that that I felt safe with taught me these things in so many discount of accepted them as fact one of my first experiences that challenge this way of thinking was during the 2000 presidential elections through college prep program I was able to take part in the national youth convention in Philadelphia my particular group's focus was on youth violence and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate the members of our group came from many different walks of life one day toward the end of the convention I found out that one of the kids I friended was Jewish now taken several days for this detail to come to light and I realized that there was no natural animosity between the two of us I've never had a Jewish friend before and frankly I felt a sense of pride and having been able to overcome a barrier that for most of my life I've been led to believe was insurmountable another major turning point came when I found a summer job at Busch Gardens amusement park as chance would have it I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay performer that show that and soon found that many were the kind this least judgmental people I ever met I don't know what it's like to be gay but I'm well acquainted with being judged for something that's beyond my control one day I had a conversation with my mother about how my worldview starting to change and she said something to me that I'll hold dear to my heart for as long as I live she looked at me with the weary eyes of someone who'd experienced enough dogmatism to last a lifetime and said I'm tired feeding in that instant I realized how much negative energy intakes that each side then that must've been so powerful yet another was one of the most transformative times in my life I pay kind of does want to let her know where my my mind was starting to go and when she told me it felt like she gave me permission to go out into the world and just experience people for who they were instead of trying to fit them into some kind of in a category or box of some kind just be free anyway the aegis What you've done as a choice that you just made a choice you decided that you were not going to be this this person that you were kind of race to be what I don't know that that's that were meant to be anything other than the sum of our experiences and I knew that from my experience that I from being bullied that I didn't want to be the bully at the same time that it want to be bullied because I knew what that felt like the loneliness and the feelings of inadequacy and self-loathing I knew that I didn't want to treat people like that and if I could I want to prevent others from treating people like that so that they didn't have to go through the same thing Dr. Abrahams, real name I changed it when my family decided to end our connection with my father and start a new life so why would I help myself and potentially put myself in danger let simple I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday was compelled to use violence Messrs. my story and realize that there is a better way but although I have been subjected to this violent intolerant ideology that I did not become finance instead I choose to use my experience to fight back against terrorism against bigotry I do it for the victims of terrorism and their loved ones for the terrible pain and loss that terrorism is forced upon their lives the victims of terrorism I will speak out against you senseless acts and condemn my father's actions and with that simple fact I stand here is proof that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race and the sun does not have to follow the ways of his father I am not my father him is these activist he's the author of the newly released book the terrorist son the story of choice can find out more about it in C zags full-time had.com role more stories of transformation in a moment and I rise and you're listening to the head radio hour from NPR it's the Ted radio hour from NPR guy rise and on the show today transformation stories and ideas about changing everything you are becoming who you are meant to be when US is strangling you look in the near do you think you want them beautiful person hybrid look great and it visits my blog is mono site I did feel beautiful that there is moments in my life where I never felt beautiful this is Jean never Sarah she's been a fashion model for about a decade and to describe Gina is beautiful something of an understatement she is starting high cheekbones long dark hair slender and when she walked into the tent stage she stood in front of a huge photo upper South in lingerie you noticed unusual addition he visited the casting call maybe felons hire me but of course you are showing that the photograph to tell of the bigger story about your journey yeah it's it's it's giving increase hence bringing magnetic memory since
at this moment in your life where you're self-conscious about what you're about detailed Emily got to do will change your life here is Gina story from the tent stage makes you something that you're not but you know inside what you are and that question burns in your heart how would you become that so when I became a fashion model I felt that I finally achieved the gene that have always wanted since I was a young child outside South finally Max making a to at the time it felt like they've done it you made it you have arrived that this October I realize that in only just beginning in my case for the last nine years felt my neighbors some of my friends colleagues even my agent did not know that my history I think in this three this is going to reveal here is mine I was assigned boy at birth dates and appearance of my genitalia this moment when you spoke to Ted Cecchini revealed this for the first time publicly is just like so he can drop in you had revealed the scene that you had to do so may people for so long you you were born a boy community remember thinking as a kid and not a boy yeah to growing up illegally squared T-shirt in my head or the blanket fabric and want my hair to be long and elegantly had in my and a limited moment when my mom asked me communally squared and I told him on this is my hand on Ankara gender has always been considered immutable but we now know it's actually more silly complex and mysterious because of my success I never had encouraged to share my story not because I thought what I am Islam and because how the world treats does the five who wish to break free every day I am so grateful because I am a woman I have a mom and bad and family accepted me for who I am many I'm not so fortunate there's a long tradition in Asian culture that celebrates the fuel efficiency of gender there's a Buddhist goddess of compassion there is a Hindu goddess had turned on felt when Alice eight years old I was at a fiesta and the Philippine celebrating this new series I was in front of the stage their number outcomes is beautiful woman right in front of me and remember that moment something hit me that is the kind of woman who would like to be so when I was 16 years old field dressing as a boy I met this woman named TL sees a transgender beauty pageant manager that night she asked me how come you are not joining the beauty pageant she convinced me that if I joined that she will take care of the registration fee in the Garmin's that night I won nothing since it and that's a long down and placed second runner up amongst 40+ candidate that moment changed my life I live people could say that your first job as a pageant clean for transcendent one without taking in 2001 when mom was moved to San Francisco called me and told me that my green card petition came through that I've now moved to United States I resisted it until my mom having fun you my friends and love traveling have you departing clean within two weeks later she called me sad the Gmail if you move the United States you could change your name and gender marker that was all I needed to hear when I must tell me typically reason the spelling of my name she also came with me when I had my surgery in Thailand 19 years old at that time in United States he needed to have the surgery before you change your name and gender marker 70,001 I moved to San Francisco and I remember looking at my California driver's license with the name Gina gender marker that powerful moment I mean some people – these are licensed to drive or even to get a drink Miguel is my license to their feel dignified I mean all of a sudden my fears for minimize I felt that I could conquer my dream and lifting your computer model you moved to York and then you get discouraged modeling how open were you about your so when I moved to New York I need a conscious decision to not only share about my journey into womanhood and first was ready to talk about the second I just knew his people had this misconception about when it means to be and I just don't want to have a conversation first inform us and it wasn't until December last year to test and 13 when he told my model agent and a transgender woman what did later agency when I made the decision to go public about this site on public undergoing the Ted stage I have them okay that's I need to talk to me and chat with and I picked up that Fogler said Ron this is one of the bats do and this is to storytelling share remember having a pause and then he said well congratulations I'm proud of you I am in on here I support you which is a big sigh of relief and remember being in a SunOS so nervous in that time consumer model in New York for more than a decade we ever afraid that somebody would I don't know find out and it would hurt your career and a gas mileage's Elyse Iman constant state of paranoia is nothing worse than being counted there's nothing worse than people taking control of your narrative so I guess it constantly adding that fear paralyze me what happened to get you to decide to do that like what inspired you to say you know what I'm can it tell people about my past eight firsts island free myself there sins that he now I guess when to be fully open things and also dissing claim we gave to the transgender community today this very moment is my real coming out I could no longer live might choose for and by myself I do my best to help others lived a truth without shame in terror my deepest truth allowed me to accept cool I am when you think about your life do you think about is a life transformed or do you think about it more of I'm sick of life restored its definitely like transform and I think I'm still transforming typing that I have I am in constant evolution especially with the support of my family that allowed me to just before you IM and added the opportunities that was presented to me that I accepted I did everything I can to achieve tactical a method to let your story and and it comes like you can't like control your circumstances right you couldn't control you were born as you bring some ways you can shape your future certainly if you are conscious of what is being presented to you to get consciousness of opportunity of really for seeing the goal or a dream he had really seen over Cerro she is the cofounder of the transgender advocacy group gender proud to find out more about Tina and to see her talk good head.NPR.org about 30 years ago on a cold January day Q her and a friend were climbing Mount Washington in New Hampshire they admitted that the difficult part of the client when theory suddenly the light snowfall turned into something far more intense and note blizzard conditions set and we got to the top of this ice face just about 800 feet and we need to seek continuing towards the summit of Mt. and ever worsening conditions Q her was an expert climber one of the top climbers in the US he declining almost since the day he could walk by the age of 1516 hrs. climbing thousand foot walls 2004 also sometimes without a rope so yes it was a was a life of adventure of secure the Back Bay in New Hampshire even Hughes considerable experience to matter he and his fellow climber Jeff Bacher climbing in whiteout conditions we had tree line we had realized we'd gone off course at that point the blizzard were so intense that it would've been suicidal to retrace her tracks the average depth of snow was to the way sometimes chest very difficult to make progress when Jeff contract for four days they huddled together in makeshift snow caves just to survive the frostbite in their legs was so severe so painful they didn't think they make it we were in one of our snow caves we'd given up hope we were trying to accelerate the death process because we're in so much pain and you know this person appeared when we first thought we were you know seeing things we first thought this person was in real she was out snowshoeing today and came across footprints seem to be human footprints and follow them to her cave and we were ultimately rescued by helicopter to conduct New Hampshire so initially they thought that they would the sacred right I wouldn't go that far.  They were the doctors were willing to attempt it but and in the beginning they look like biological legs that would simply black in some areas and swollen but eventually after a month or two they no longer looked human at that point you know you mentally psychologically one hell once to get rid of the of of the legs that really cannot even be labeled as legs anymore Hugh hers transformation would begin the moment his legs were amputated a rehab center he was fitted with these clunky uncomfortable prostatic legs this doctor warned them that you have a long and hard recovery I said you know I will not return the mountain climbing I want to ride a bicycle since a few such things in the sentry quickly that climbing was out of the question I'm I might feel right at bicycle he said I appeal to drive a car through the use of hand controls Violet I was devastated by the conversation than I realized he had no idea what climbing once so he had no real authority to state that I would would not be able to Klein again losing his leg seemed like the ultimate transformation but the real change into hers life was just beginning he picks up the story from the tent stage I didn't view my body is broken I reason that a human being can never be broken technology is broken technology is inadequate this simple but powerful idea was a call to arms to advanced technology for the elimination of my own disability and ultimately to the disability of others I began by developing specialized lens that allow me to return to the vertical world of rock and ice climbing I quickly realized that the artificial part of my body is not able able to take on any form any function a blank slate switch to create prep structures that could extend beyond biological capability I made my height adjustable to be as short as five feeders tolls I'd like so I was feeling badly about myself insecure I would Jack migrate up allows feeling confidence swallowed not my hike down a notch just to give the competition a chance narrow ledge feet allow me to climb steep drop figures with human foot cannot penetrate and spiked feet enable me climb vertical ice walls without ever experiencing muscle leg fatigue through technological innovation I returned to my sport stronger and better technology had limited my disability allow me a new climbing prowess and as he returned to competitive climbing using prostatic legs and he designed himself you've got more and more interested in how to make those legs better so I invented this prophetic foot made of polyethylene blades coated with sticky declining rubber could put the blade into the crack and rotate the leg and wedge it and then extend the leg and make progress of the mountain so the fun with people of course accuse me of cheating and you said you can know you're your free completely free to amputate your legs and achieve the same competitive advantage no one took me up on have to take that leap from being told that you he would not give it to do this definitively to tell yourself good this perhaps some stubborn know some people view an artificial limb as something is depressing the source of disability I viewed as a source of adventure of potential they realize that to innovation to design that artificial part of my body could be anything I wanted so is losing his legs was the first transformation and then designing his own prostatic legs was the second he was about to undergo the third and possibly most profound transformation yet an story in a moment and I rise in your listening to the head radio hour from NPR it's the head radio hour from NPR I'm die rise in on the show today transformation stories and ideas about a life completely changed by choice or in the case if you her by circumstance so we were just hearing about how Hugh lost his legs in a rock climbing accident and before it happened he wasn't particularly interested in math or science or technology we really wanted to be was the best rock climber in the world but then after the accident when I experienced how hideous sin pathetic unsophisticated Hasidic technology was at that time I became interested in design I design my climbing lions and I was successful at that endeavor and economy drove me towards study mathematics and physics and later engineering and it turns out I just looked at my absolute passion for those topics so as you are to improve and perfect his own prostatic he decided to pursue mechanical engineering and then later a PhD in biophysics and he became convinced that he could transform other people which is what he does today he leads a team of scientists at MIT working to solve one simple problem design we have no idea how to attach synthetic structures to our bodies and a healthy comfortable way example of shoes giving us blisters is an extraordinary one of the most mature oldest devices in the human timeline the shoe we still don't understand how to design the damping rate so every device that attaches to her body no women with bras braces prostheses like eyewear can be very very uncomfortable rate now if you ask no hundred persons with leg amputation what's the number one problem you want solved about your official and probably all hundred would say it hurts no please fix that so you set out to do just a the woman on this recording is for the first time trying out a pair of ionic legs designed by Hugh Herder and his team at MIT and she can now walk up and down stairs is no hand rail she's not using a cane no help from anyone it is inside her legs there are 12 sensors that feed right into microcomputers very small computers surface area roughly on the fingernail and those computers run algorithms to decide how to tweak any motors in each like which control how the limb should move what should stiffen function power itself he wears a pair himself he says these prophetic legs with power with moving parts designed to mimic the force of normal muscles could transform life for disabled people of all kinds you see anyone know what you so you will a all you and as a map and you will it's amazing to some is like this country of you to reimagine the work you are you are to be and what this disability was coming it sounds like you kind of turn it into something something that made you like better and stronger my new body with biological leg amputations is not necessarily a disability right disability comes and if that is if the technology is a inadequate if the technology is very good it simply a condition but it's not a disability that's the world that I envisioned the world that I'm working towards technologically over half of the worlds population suffers from some form of cognitive emotional sensory or motor condition and because of poor technology too often conditions result in disability and a poor quality of life basic levels of physiological function should be a part of our human rights every person should have the right to live life without disability if they so choose the right to live life without severe depression the right to see a loved one in the case of seeing impaired with the right to walk her to dance in the case of limb paralysis or limb amputation as a society we can achieve these human rights if we accept the proposition that humans are not disabled a person can never be broken our built environment are technologies are broken and disabled we the people need not accept our limitations but can transcend disability the technological innovation indeed to fundamental advances in robotics in the century we'll set the technological foundation for and enhance human experience and we will end disability what you think it is that allowed you to to Michael regenerated to kind of extent and then to embrace a transformation that you didn't ask for I think at the core is nothing contrary to the Tito being creative is imagining what hasn't happened yet imagining what the future can be believing and that dream so wholeheartedly that inspire yourself in the world actually transfer dreams into physical objects and technology Q her runs the Center for extreme bionics at MIT to see his talk and the amazing work they do Gary Ted.com the show today ideas and stories about transformation the people who look at their lives and say to change this one thing or maybe everything were talking about your life right in this life that you once had is it feel I can some way that you are not talking about a different person yeah yeah because of December.  The class and back and just like wondering what my face look like back the wonder if I ever smiled little flick a smile to their slogan back is that while the document believe this examiner may not have moments where a credit for that young man that I was this is a shock as single or he's a writer and a mentor to young people trying where you grew up and here's how he began his story 1023 years ago at the age might see son killed I was young drugged the with a quick temper and so momentous but there was an animal story in fact it was the this story acknowledgment apology in its own what is in heaven which might imagine the C library view one up I was on a roll please become a doctor the phase was medically wrong my parents separated and eventually divorce Chuck explains that when his parents split up grade started to fall's mom was abusive but mentally and physically tough years later he started to sell drugs there is something I got sacked three times the animal block in short my family to the hospital `without actually the city back to the throughout this ordeal no one hardly notes on the okay no one told me that I live in fear no become paranoid told me that one day I will become the perseverance written 14 months later a fire sauce because Samantha not as a prison angry I was hurt don't take responsibility I reacted with hostility to multiplying a ramp by Marcus stores along search the social of illegally smuggled prison added Friday, with the war to miss reformatory: the worst or worse because the activity I landed a solid certain farm 7 1/2 years of my customers that is so hard to imagine living like that many hydrogen did you start to go from that place to where you you eventually got to do what you are now know it it to a growth stages update the first time was I read Malcolm X. autobiography this is ability to redeem himself in terms of how cannot print my consciousness in a way to make me think like this is possible is so literature Me strong and you know whenever I felt also more vulnerable to feel like I was going to go insane or filler can cope one more day in this little six by Merryfield I would just try to live its own sort of books and a begin at some point a begin set Marcelo Bakos classroom and I will study a different subject each hour is available in school and candlelight that seven point K of the received a letter from my oldest son and it sounded as though my son it was like a real life in the darkest places you must notice that they do own newsletter in the capital letters he wrote moments on why he was imprisoned murder said that don't kill Jesus was switching the praise him not was a religious offense harm normal religious now but it was something so profile while most laws were the first time in my life that I thought about that Massimo Cimino's murder; and I reflected on something I read Plato's Republic was Socrates stated in the polity that the unexamined life is worth living at that point is when transformation begin when he wrote that letter you know you maybe realized that you know whatever happened with don't approve not that I had a responsibility as a father to give Muslim example of what a mere suet be what he could this will be given to her work was uncovering how to learn imprisoned in the first I just saw the most basic simple way that I would do whatever was necessary to reclaim the parts needed on the good began to write a journal about things that expressed my childhood in the present and what it is over the marks the idea of time earlier my frustration I received a letter from when the relatives Muppet Internet matter some sister gave because you will not solve within you the business horses this miniseries for decisions it was the first animal life that I felt open to forgive them also you think that just the capacity to humans have regenerate like yourself regeneration and for almost rebirth you have to think it's like inherent human capability or do you think that you some some people had that ability yes I do not think that human beings are so resilient and I think that we have failed to acknowledge that we chance to make transformation of fridge so so to speak as something this abnormal or in no or not only superhuman supernumerary and I'm never thought of it like that when it becomes small personal journey when you are in prison is audible authenticity in that environment you know of guys that you are trying to play the good guy to get paroled or to give favor from offices in something like that they'll pray on it you know about a note it is genuine and is not based on fear but is based on you one would be who you were destined to be they respectively celebrate there and what I realized that the majority of of men I can't have the desire for something different something better of the thing that was lacking was the courage to step on their own for somebody to give them permission to step on their own, and I think what happened with me is that I learned how to give myself permission you mentioned that hotel and from Socrates and that the unexamined life not not being worth living it sounds weird but like Junot gone through the payment that you enter your life easy may not have had an examined life it is true in old hat I'm not going to the spirit of this experienced Garcia Ignacio the most
read we know the typical trajectory is you get up to go to work you pay the bills you come home secure your family repeat but I found that life is so much deeper than that we have to give ourselves permission to expand and grow and evolve as human beings before major and it wasn't easy it wasn't no it wasn't right of sale wasn't didn't come without its challenges in the Windows release from prison of their their cost and service constant battles and income homes will rose the neighborhood in our time back home to Detroit in old cigar grew up in Fraser global now who some are still in Street culture and living you don't have butcher lives I spent a lot of thing I discovered is this the majority minimum were classroom everything anybody can have transformation if we create a that so will ask today is that you envision the world where men and women are held hostage today pass were missed these mistakes of the five arrest
