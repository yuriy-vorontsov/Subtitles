When designing a commercial structure, the architect must make the hallways wide enough for a wheelchair. 
The materials must be compatible with its surrounding climate.
The beams must be able to support the building and withstand the wind.
The building should be dynamic, interesting, comfortable, and ready to be completely abandoned if it burns.
There are a number of considerations for how a building should respond to emergency.
Horns, versus strokes, versus speakers.
The pulsating frequency of the light; the intensity of the light; smoke dampening. 
It goes on and on.
There's the sprinklers, the panic bars, you know the spring-loaded horizontal bar that you push to unlock emergency exit?
The smoke detectors--what kinds you use and the distances between them.
You know, a lot of people hardly even look up and see these things and they just need to be there when an emergency happens.
Now, Adam Winick and Daniel Scoville are architects.
We work with them at [unintelligible] in beautiful downtown Oakland, California.
Most of the time when they're working on fire safety, they'll consult experts about where to place what kinds of architectural emergency devices, but there's one safety device that they must design right into the building from the get-go.
It's impossible to ignore.
As far as stair location, that's pretty important right from the start because it changes the whole dynamic of your space.
Typically buildings required two fire stairs, but it all depends on the size and purpose of the structure.
And architecture, and building codes.
You always need a certain number of exits or means of egress, so ways out of building.
And this fire escape precariously bolted to the side of building is is one of our means of egress out of this space.
This is how 99% invisible is gonna escape a burning building.
This is how [unintelligible] and 99% invisible are gonna escape a burning building.
In case of fire architects Daniel Scoville and Adam Winick and producer Avery [unintelligible] would put their steely resolve and athletic prowess to the test.
There's classic wrought iron fire escape right outside of our window and I thought it was defunct, it's all rusty and stuff, but then I bothered to read the sign with the evacuation plan for our building.
Always read the evacuation plan.
Fire escapes are not allowed in new construction but because we are in a beautiful old brick building, the fire escape is actually one of our means of egress.
We just speak of means of egress thinking of the whole route, the corridor, and the stairs, and you think or an exit as being essentially the door.

One of my books is called "The Fireproof Building can't remember the subtitle it's the fireproof building technology and public safety in the 19th century American city the single most dangerous thing architecture historically inspired in the 1700s the fire did break that there was a whole lot you can do about that time there were firefighters summoned by yelling loudly and they would come it would bring you the fires it was a card with a ladder on it that was actually what the earliest fire escapes were so fire escape methods started to get incorporated into architecture starting with us like a skylight it would have some kind of comfort was like a trap door on the roof and then there'd be a ladder to to get up and out and so I your client through the scout out onto the roof to your neighbor scale and crawl into Vanderbilt which presumably had also caught fire beginning this idea that the city could require something for the sake of fire safety around 1860 New York begins to require means of egress impediment buildings tenement buildings were tall flammable densely packed tinderbox is just full of families sympathized landlord like with the least expensive options the popular cheap fix was wrote ropes with baskets that you're supposed to somehow you know the buildings on fire you have your kids you're terrified and you commonly open this this little nightstand pullout basket with the hopes you know set up the apparatus strap yourself and somehow you know lower yourself calmly to the ground you know it is just preposterous and hilarious old advertisements for fake cabinets and holler for traders and anti-washing machines that you can store your ropes and basket apparatus because no one would notice that extra washing machine one engineer actually thought that instead of dispatching reps from inside archers could shoot the ropes up the higher floors in a people aren't that athletic necessarily to begin with but the ball it's a fire this is the best time to eat a white figure out how will yourself on a row another patent proposed individual parachute hats with accompanying rubber shoes to break the fall there also these big slide fire escapes that were largely marketed the schools as both emergency devices and playground equipment there actually used to be a giant spiral slide to escape the Claremont Hotel right here in Oakland which what made that plays a lot better if it were lots of ideas but by the 1870s fire escapes begin becoming something iron something fixed to the building although by that point they still weren't anything great they were like iron platform outside of the window with straight ladders attached or it might just be a straight ladder clamped to the wall in some cities the external latter is angled and lighting to become more like stairs this was an improvement of course but ultimately fire escapes just didn't suffice and it took a terrible tragedy to show this so the ash building in New York was built as a loft building and its owners representative as being in a maybe for warehousing not necessarily for manufacturing based on its dimensions â€“ building was required to have 3-D the egress but the developer insisted that the property would just be used as warehousing surrounded and three stairs he was allowed to put into stairs and then fire escape then the owner rents the top three floors of the ash building to the triangle shirtwaist Company in March 1911 there's a fire in the building is not know exactly how begins and it it it spreads quickly the 10th floor has an exit to the roof so many that can flow workers are able to survive by taking the stairs and the workers on the eighth floor are by and large able to get out the workers on the ninth floor were trapped the doors of the stairs opened inward became blocked with bodies of the stairs backed up with workers exiting from the floors below the workers on the ninth floor couldn't get down only a few workers on the floor new about the 10th floor exit and so they didn't even try to go upstairs there was charge that one of the doors was locked and this was improved of the trial but I believe he had been with all the people exiting from the eighth floor and staircases were very narrow and winding there just wasn't the capacity some workers tried to use the outside fire escape and it collapsed under the weight it was from the windows of the ninth floor that many workers desperate to escape the flames and smoke fell or jump to their deaths 146 people lost their lives right in the middle of Greenwich Village there were a lot of witnesses it was horrible but the building was fine the ash building was a fireproof building and of course it's still standing and it's now part of New York University the asked building now called the brown building was well-made which is why the time no one really thought it needed and egress admitted he has were problems people fought for the tenants and the poor quality buildings the logic was in the building was first class it was in itself say for the occupants and the people could this be safely locked inside of these noncombustible buildings the triangle fire proves that architecture couldn't protect us we had to protect ourselves from architecture this is when an organization called the national fire protection Association does a lot of studies in thinking you know about egress a good egress meant getting rid of fire escapes for so many reasons they weren't commonly used so they were often out of order in states of disrepair a northern climates that are covered with snow or eroded by rain and not everyone can access them like people disabilities and the very young and elderly and women who are hamstrung by the fashion of the time women in these long skirts might not have the president might take off their score is they could actually get out also fire escapes are scary using some narrow rickety staircases on really tall buildings that make you feel like you should strap on rubber shoes and appears you have any people weren't easy using fire escapes they often didn't know where they were people try to leave the way they came here that that's the thing and that's where modern fire escapes commit they're not bolted to the side of the building they are the logical place where you would go in emergency they are the stairs while they look like normal stairs but really there pieces of emergency equipment enclosing fireproof walls and sealed with a self-closing door and covered with sprinklers on the lines and because they work perfectly with Alastair ways there often the stairway in a building so up the building won't have the grand stairway any longer it'll have a lot of elevators and fire six goodbye opulent lobbies with sweeping brand sterilize if you like to take the stairs you probably already bemoaned the fact that they are always shoved off into a tower and are very cold and industrial matter what the building looks like from the outside if we want we can make him look good but most clients elect to spend money on things of people you see more always mean an architect Adam Winick again the stairways need to be was called rated meaning that they need to be enclosed in a type of construction that won't melt or lower fire to penetrate as quickly as a nonrenewable these rated towers can be like buildings within buildings a prime example of a souped-up fire stairway is an freedom Tower the freedom Tower which has this emergency core which is on its own separate electric: plumbing system and has its own elevators and stairs Atlantic use is a professor at Wesleyan University am also a practicing architect and I run a small firm called free projects and part of that for free involves doing research on architecture emergency he's particularly fascinated by these core structures around the horn and the emergency cores are modeled with software and simulation solely this program Exodus 4.0 edition axis V.0 can simulate how quickly a floor of a building can be cleared based on the maximum number of bodies that would be allowed in the space how quickly could these bodies exit the space so the architect or actually more likely the consultant will plug in the measurements of the building all the information about emergency equipment and maximum number of occupants and basically click play and watch the digital people escape the pixel flames a lot of agent-based modeling programs with humans don't work terribly welcomes teams done necessarily behave predictably but in emergencies they do give an adequate signage people will behave in predictable ways in the event of an emergency so this makes sense we've already established that in emergency people don't want to go places they having gone to before or use devices that never seen or no figure out if they can catch a rope shot at them with a bow and arrow the way egress works now is in keeping with the way that we use buildings normally even though rated towers take up a lot of space and money and make for an unpleasant stepping experience it's hard to argue with this solution this let's say there were nearly 2012 in nonresidential structures there were 65 that in the whole year in a primer people were struck by lightning actually 28 people were struck by lightning than 2012 so even though each one is a tragedy 65 best doesn't strike me as on this number is already down from 2003 where there were 220 deaths and nonresidential buildings so these are the buildings with heavy regulations and core structure modern emergency equipment and egress procedures are really helping to minimize the effects of fire accidents but from an aesthetic standpoint it's almost a pity despite it's a beautiful and although I'm not really thrilled at the prospect of clambering down the fire escape outside my window do like to look at numbers are warm fire escapes even ones are no longer in use of his physical reminder that we evolved past me in a culture that says here's wrote good luck buddy I dislike seeing them and hope that they'll be preserved because it just makes me realize how we kind of have to work together as a society you have to rely on other people to put in the stairs to follow the rules for the rules to be there and that's what makes the same as somewhere in the city I live in a fire a I somewhere in the city I
