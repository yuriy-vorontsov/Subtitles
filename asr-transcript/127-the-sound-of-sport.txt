This is 99% invisible I'm Roman Mars a couple of days ago we presented a story breeze by paragraph Andrews about how certain sounds like the sounds of skis on a cross-country track on a horse racing track were faked on sports broadcasts in and up being one of our most popular and provocative episodes ever mainly because people really taken aback by the notion that any part of a sporting event might be faked that episode was just a small excerpt of a much longer documentary called the sound of sport and get a number of request for audience of the years asking where they can hear the entire piece and today my friends when you're going to present it to you in its full glory this is a fascinating exquisitely produced deep dive into the sound designer sports broadcasting subject found that most people have never even considered before that's just one of the reasons why I love he reminds was originally broadcast in 20 elevenths was after the World Cup in South Africa and before the London Olympic Games 2012 so distant place in the proper sports history context this is the sound of sport respect Hernandez for punching productions and presented by Dennis Baxter will I like listening close my eyes and hear every single one in my head it's my belief that people had ingrained in them a memory of certain sounds and if that Sion is not for field then the mind knows that there's something wrong there is an expectation of what football sounds like it certainly wasn't presented noise driving people just that continuous home which is drowned out the meaningful noises the sound of the World Cup in South Africa and the the diseases for many people this was the first time they've really thought about how sports you sound that is what I spend my life thinking and dreaming about and inspection in a design the sound sports television the newly 20 years of work exclusively on the Olympics as their staff sound designer and engineer I decide how to capture each of them sonically so the brings as much drama and excitement into the home as possible during a for London 2012 is going to be a big job of using the team of 350 sound mixers about 600 sound technicians and close to 4000 microphones in was born in Atlanta Georgia in 1954 and essentially think that I've been a sound person in my entire life when is about eight or nine years old Mme. bought me a cassette recorder and I was recording everything I was going to the bathroom amount of human toilet and at this popular the microphone start recording her Michael had a restaurant no washing off a lot of dishes was 14 years old and enough money to buy real ceramic thousand dollars.  It was a staggering sum in 1968 this is the size of a big suitcase the drives are used to HIV care that recorded to the churches and to the high schools and records that anything that could possibly record I was a veteran so score my G.I. Bill and study economics the taught me a lot about borrowing money so it into my college degree I done my final paper's own recording studio and had convinced the bank to lend the money and before I knew it I was several hundred thousand dollars in debt the recording studio dream misguided during the nature of music and live happily ever after and all of a sudden you're struggling to get people in the studio recording things that you don't want to record and frustrated with the situation in just is away from the first event on the ESPN schedule 1982 and another more profitable use of Monte skills at the newly formed sports television channel ESPN seven musicians now is catching the sound car racing tennis baseball football whatever they sent my way manuscript I humbly ask you to grab your game 1948 of that was the first Olympics to be televised by the BBC the fewer than 100,000 homes had television the time Nevada at this rate is advice that develop and if anything the phase and Venezuela
you can hear there is a much more than commentary to be heard back it up it is expected and seven thanked about my own relationship the Olympics begin in 1992 for the first full-time job as a sound soccer I went back and listen to every single sport trying to understand why we were covering the sports the way that we wore what sounds where they are in what sounds really missing in one I came from music I came from a recording studio and I want to applaud those techniques and standards to the live world and one of the first things we implement the Olympics was a lot more close Mike this is where you can microphone as close as possible to the sound source if you use this technique in the a lot of microphone because each microphone can only capture a little piece of the whole picture but you get more detail and definition and a hell a lot better sound the parallel bars and the uneven bars for the lens gymnastic when you put the microphones that close to the athlete you hear the flexing of the bar you hear the reason you can hear the rustling of the clothing him and her her will and will will Monday it was very anti-rock 'n roll in the government out to guitar and I was just thrilled welcome Christmas morning he got me guitar and it was an acoustic guitar with kidnappings record I love chatting to this day with the next two years after I got the acoustic guitar all I was trying to do was make it louder will stumble across content microphone which is a device a microphone which you actually can stick right own to the top of the guitar amplifier except the actual vibrations of the woods and consequently the sound of the talk 30 years later I'm looking at gymnastics balance meme is a synthetic resin type of material that athletes they balance owned they do somersaults they do all kinds of routines on top of it in our meetings sounds being sending a that has a certain resonance and there is it we cannot hear that someone probably has never heard is that a new texture that we should put into the mix and by the time we put the contact microphones on the big gave a new level of depth because the content microphone here's the vibration in the entire ball believe the athlete on the bargaining the death in the movement but in what is MMVIII we get in 2008 the team responsible for the sound of the Wimbledon men's final was nominated for best award I love atmosphere that is my Job is from as I'm concerned it's the atmosphere that you generate makes people believe the I'm Bill Liston and I'm the sound supervisor who did the sound for the 2008 Wimbledon tennis finals gents that's the sound of but hush bouncing the ball on the court that atmosphere is something that I am trying to bring into the home at half when everybody is fully expectant of something brilliant him off both there's lots more basically the course is covered by very nice small stereophonic stuck on the back "just above the sublime judges had so what really causes an interesting moment when the that I will there are other multiple installs and runs the course looking back at the crowd above the crowd to get a general atmosphere of me and so cost him off fulltilt and you will no doubt the ceiling pillars of share with me contestants all sitting by the side of the chair during changeovers that you have an array of microphone social mature and those used these days absence Mr. McEnroe's outburst to try and pick up anything is interesting and said to them via of said I suspect this SF prophesies is that at the end you the way things used to be covered way back in the early days was to have what was called up Limp Bizkit microphone they'd stick bouts over the top of the imposed chassis to the minimum bar as well as the role the distance smashes of the bowl experts that such profit that is able, involving football that he profits says the status and the fact that it when I first joined outside costs still doing molar it walls early 80s and the results to do cool to in stereo to save we could develop techniques doing that I'm came to in the end using quotes apportioned expensive among very weatherproof microphone is a beautiful story microphone but really normally used for covering status then that's immense that your players rushing movie grounds (they run run the court if you that's no gold into surround technique where you have another knew the crowd and the players in front of you but the crowd also goes away around the back of you so when you're in the middle the cheering crowds spin coating will surrounds really involves you in the place you like it's like should being off the 15th the limit range the difference between the cause boys the loudest noise does not keep you on your toes if you got the cold mix on the ferry that a new type of thing the down in anticipation of it getting very loud "you do it ahead of time here in the effect what you go to do this time it's in such a way that's the second the box quiet atmosphere changes into the huge rule from the crowd you've got a split second to fake doughnuts effect off over the years of develop the sort of six cents in a way the guests pretty much about nine times out of 10 will the transcript to getting that exciting stillness anticipation of them is huge role with school developed some really wonderful half F I'm skipping the composer that would be the right time to sit if this eighth the doll now the second set point what was brilliance about that particular photo was that they listed breve they didn't talk over with time I have had a number of people say to me is there any way that we could have a feed the logical data I think that would be something that people would really appreciate because your income to the juices of the eligible would telecoms that shuttle think many do now I'm Barry Davison.  As a benevolent federal on various things those I would just for Michael incentivized positions just for 16 seconds why not the sound crowd and the the strongly supported my mind don't want to say say nothing section best policy but everyone forgets… Being carried in the motion a euro 96 when by Germany in 75 can remember about full interested 10 minutes James came out so good sound from around the state just with a few old observation: save a as the opposition as anyway may be unaware oh will achieve but if you go bunch of people sitting at home doing terrific much the delicious ache goes with some terrific but you know assume before we do not Mr. of the student's family and then 12 Mike's pitch which you fate of the booms of dumb bitch was Jason city kicks me Scotland's mission to stuff the different techniques give trust people the is anticipating movables don't go personally I don't favor the system of fixed microphones around the pitch the bill describes I prefer to use roving operators who each point a directional microphone at the action they follow the action I believe this is a better more defined kickstand is a method of use at the last for its use in London for the 2012 football events okay now is a game from the Athens Olympics in 2004 every Olympic Games I try to rush of the excitement in entertainment and certainly winter sports of fun because you trying to convey a sense of speed in motion of always enjoy the sound of bobsled Vancouver there were 44 cameras each camera position there was a distinctly different oral perspective and is trying to put reviewer the list them in the place of the athlete and I made every camera position hey sounds up some people may say 284 microphones is a bit excessive you have to remember that every camera perspective every visual perspective with the viewing audience has a different sound texture in a different sound the color quite a piece of music that he just sit and listen to the crowd you hear like how it swells and I pizza and then suddenly burst sounds to me like an orchestra I broughtmay sound effects recordist for movies in Hollywood I get hired by the movie studios to record sound specifically for their movie for example if you have specific sports movie yet horseracing hockey figure skating football basketball they bring me into capture the essence of the crowds and the game itself the sound of the basketballs the sound of horses hooves horses breathing players tackling each other electronic good stuff so they bring me and so that they can re-create the feeling of being really into that event when you see the game will verify it was the greatest team in any sport I have seen the gamer their lives as a football movie but the 1950 US men's national soccer team that was competing in the World Cup in Rio in Brazil and they went on to beat England which was shocking at the time because England was the best team on the planet in America was probably one of the worst teams I was asked to go down a record football crowds for the movie in North America we don't have football crowds that are that exciting and rambunctious I went to Brazil and I recorded football games I went to remedy Stadium to record again between Brazil and Bolivia and the crowd was same they would just you move around Adium and listen four pockets of chanting and cheering her loud fans and listening for the energy they are out of their minds singing in huge conflict runs when you can feel someone screaming that's are coming out is there yelling that's good to translate you hear it in the movie I'm looking to record the people that are really passionate into it and so I would set up near them I had a handheld recorder I try to not let them know so I didn't want to change their performance in he had people in the loop group actors they're not getting go that deep screen like a fan and an audience well it's amazing when you can re-create with real people that energy that's the way to do a sports movie sound puts you in the actual environment and it really does create an emotional response my name is Gordon give any I am the studio audio director at electronic arts Canada specifically the sports videogame and the company submit games like fee for hockey soccer American football golf but what's the entire range of sports taking a scientific approach to a very emotional process which is let's reanalyze how crowds were this big boss of sound waves exactly once if that guy in the corner that displaces painted purple he's got his team showed on it's got a big Drummond's trying to get his corner of the Stadium all riled up maybe a wave starts around the state or maybe doesn't so your future pushes Redskins actually modeling how crowds behave and how these different particles of Soundex interact to create a large crowd we would a lot at how can we keep improving the actual game experience we try to bring it down as authentic as possible but then we have to go beyond because normally you would not hear it are the details of the some of the pitch on TV but the gameplay you expect to hear the kicks those last South African World Cup with high people in South Africa record the crowds with the builder game arguments in advance of the event we actually had the crowd come back in South Africa and I went down to one of the audio sound geysers I kept hearing this bee hives gone on what is this thing Mrs. drive me bonkers that cannot turn that they'd offered out Gizmodo is a lose lose everything if it's part of baby have to have this was not invented we actually put amid button on finally to say that you can unit four or lower the volume on the and then when the actual World Cup starting South Africa people say no talk of the TV channels cats put a mute but like they do in the actual videogame.here's another one of my favorite sports all for example really trying to isolate the micro sounds of the sport you really separate the above sounds in the swimming home in the below sounds the underwater sound are really conveys the sense of the focus since of isolation of the athlete the microphones of the handrails divers walk up you can hear the hand she does your defeat if you've been reading all in have a microphone at the bottom of the pool under the water the athlete goes into the water with some perspective to see in the underwater sound levels you get the complete sense of isolation and complete of the athlete all along in archery unlike the sport after hearing the coverage in Barcelona the 92 Olympics there were things that were missing the easy things were there the thought in the impact of the target that's a no-brainer in a little bit of the athlete is there getting ready but probably goes back to the movie Robin Hood I have a memory of the same and I have an expectation solace going okay will be really really cool and archery to take it up a notch in the obvious thing was the sound of the arrow going through the air to the target which predict typhus and so we lifted a little thing called the boundary microphone that would lay flat was flatter than a pack cigarettes up a little windshield on an update on the ground between the athlete and the target a it completely opened up the sound to something different and will for some reason directors don't like to see the microphones they do like hearing good sound but there is a resistance connection same microphones in the picture which is one of the challenges that we have in the boundary microphone for feel that challenge because you could creep the microphone closer to the actual source both young lineup about football get girl sizes ofJan Busby Dotty came… Of not go
update the sake you started up I like this bill on the left side had on what we find ourselves in a quite glorious day down on the Thames of the boat race and it's absolutely magnificent Paul Davis and executive producer peeps East portico of the tennis rugby union golf by race a few other things sound is its hidden jewel is it really am and I think it's one of those things that one takes for granted because progress reasons you can't see it always going great not also refers to it when he goes wrong there is literally at the deathly silence on a huge supporter of sound in the outside world cost television and I think the guys that we work with really respect you felt about having company having everyone in my 90 James on the sensitive Isa where the young of the Beit Raisa Putney and my Job is at 'seeing with what you have, I ran my you guys are usually whenever I look at a show on Tron best written the sand that this was my example cuts of the Rudy really good shot of the cruise when you can see the looks on the faces I want to hear every bit of effort that putting incident strike and that's really want Elizabeth make sure every show UP we can actually send making that thinking of me to put out this nice little about transferring very good quite often little motivation for directing out several costs it is visually driven but often nothing I can come from sound as well but if we have two very motivating coaxes and that both Mike Toppin that delivering some outstanding sound then there's a real motivation a to hear that sound to understand what that delivering instruction wise in and actually just wet atmosphere as well then that's usually motivating and simply going visually to that cameras to see the cults delivering it and then how the rows are reacting to it as well set those motivational reasons for hearing set of things great raw other than a just been wallpaper but… Is that I got subscribe I in one I three leading you begin you read poultry of the proxy but have one family of seven Bauhaus sleeper suitable totaled seven on the boat race we go six different sure signs would in the course with
which is where the but stopped and we've got various stereo effects my company and the Temple and then as we move from side to side moving down the course we have effects Mike said that it regularly us here to mix the main main sand we also have Mike's on the crew beds themselves and on the chase boats so we can pick The various different effects that we need as the Prince move of downriver a tie as a we stopped at the first health program will be a presentation open when the presenters will be producing what's going on Voting will be with us this is the time is@get the latest is not going to fall we live in all velocity is winning create Cambridge University the first element that we move into the race itself on basically meeting my SanDisk Mr. Wright starting with business five days jail about a 96 by the mixing desk.  I'm starting from the kind enough, country likes them when stroke is so important has to get 600 more to come the first one is a platform is various high distant effects Mike's one of the place which isn't a panoramic view of Putney then we move on Dan tools on fate of 41 by narrowing to Mike's in the boat has themselves 12 then with Condit into the race itself stalled to the race and we put him on his bed as the embodies the restarted then his" and so Mr. effects might hopefully pick up the sand of the rowing vacancies on the beds have Michael than those who want on the anything the sometimes the language that comes from the cult's and broke Constable so we have to have an opportunity to go to and that's part of the the life children basically work what the coat is a saying easy transmissible but nevertheless what they saying is if you really good information happening in at Langley I I great me I I made on think about I only he they were into the very show sites serves another distinct phases than their actual sites which will build pickup friends that are lucrative to the first places on the rights they tend to gives the color because there were policies will by building up the multilayered oval picture I also have the great that is just before and the they will without limiting but I think Brian McBride background image one 71 x 9 David of one the bed was a finding that is the so slightly in the finals to become as since the 15 as a spectator Eugene the greatest of the race gestalt within considering between what weekdays is conveying at this theater race for the view a significant much better experience celebration everything is there candidates please know about layering with pitches this degree of layering but it's fairly clear conflict to your cutting between pitches with the sound that you can build up the layers in covering anthems for example during six Nations of whether you when you go spend some shots of the teams trekking along the close-ups of the players do US want to hear the closing of the Stadium what do you want to hear you respect the Philly soul singing of the individual players an interesting mix the sound guys have deal with visual the personality and and feeling of the was bill from their not sung very well if you didn't hear the sounds of tool then you feel that you did I when we do would be these days we have a ready Mike the referee is used to sit with originally but it was transmitted eventually the Tribune officials said to Mrs. this wonderful addition to the country that's what it is and spoke the country think about so much don't think you could use the technique for if you you may see José José I they identified the thoughts all so the additional microphone on the rugby referee open up another dimension fiction writing the game you can be the place I believe that is the future sports town microphones on the athletes and players themselves if you persuade and where the confusion of the sport the benefited hugely from his technique that is that curling was introduced in to the Olympics in 1988 when the winter Olympics went to Calgary restaurant on curling that curling that said that how are we going to make curling exciting how we can introduce curling to the world in early on we started putting microphones wireless microphones on the Carruthers well you know this is a pocket for you back posted dear strategy they're encouraging each other the talking constantly talking there's a lot of screaming is a very very vocal support overall I think they are gathered there artificially regular voice effortful it brings the intimacy to the audience in it has really been a huge boost in the ratings in the interest in the sports I with the video gives an interesting position in that are the player on the field you also the viewer of the game so you sort of in this weird place where this sort of a spectator which also active participant what we've done with the sound is that we had to pretty much exaggerated this is a boxing game you record the real boxes but we just don't get the clean sound to get likely the grunts and groans and punches and impact we go into a studio and sometimes will re-create a boxing ring to do about the feet and the falls and then what will do his will close Mike scornfully artisans but give the people that do the footsteps and all the sort of hand props and everything for film and television will have the prison that punch punching bag or side of beef but whatever and this get all of the actual plant sounds a high low medium hard different angles that will get voice to come in and do things like all that's not the boxing's list of all the grunts and groans and we've been having things like don't break celery and glared into a body impacts out get cracking grid type sound it's all of those elements we carefully craft in the studio environment and veteran relator that back into the game and we blend that in and at the wide present of venues in the dress of all up the whole let effect of that is that it does feel fairly authentic on the tennis game called grand slam tennis what I did was to go out of tracking that was try to get tapes from the French Open similar identities from Wimbledon as well through able to get a number of matches with different players in different sizes of venues and this basically extract the crowd from their and Neil McEnroe on the Williams sisters in the plants you have a unique service shrieks and screams that Venezuela's dude rack able to pull that off the tape as well I think it was Venus said wow you know it sounds just like the survey is it well it is exactly like deserving of it is you serving that we extracted off I was doing American car racing the cart NASCAR in this particular race was a half-mile oval in essentially what would be considered a football type stadium with very high banking the cars put in 40 dB of sound may be more than you put 40 of those cars on a half-mile track and it just sounds like a witness there's no real definition Nelson the show is over and there supposedly is the war of the crowd the producer screened hockey of chronicling your the crowd is a very basic physics issue work this town that I want being master being drowned out by these cars that's okay now learn my lesson I went back to my home studio and I started pulling up some crown samples and building different textures and things like that so my next race know when they showed Cranach start sneak in some suffering and when it came to the end of it is a very very nice crafts will in the same producers that you know you didn't add a voice in this is great this is I want to see what were trying to achieve in a week later he found out that I'd use the sample and then I get a call to your cheating and since the hand well get right to my cheating in my cheating the audience know the audience sees the crap the audience has certain expectations you see a craggy here crap off there's some spores that she just cannot capture the natural sound cross-country skiing biathlon his another one because of the size of the course and this is been further complicated because as the camera lenses and gone the 1000 2000 3041 these cameras are able to see I have to clumsily be MacCallum renowned force and how do you replicate that sound essentially if you got cameras there are that far apart from each other your putting 20 or 30 microphones to fill is the athletes are coming teeth which is not part I am not a purist whatsoever and sound production I truly believe that what ever the tool takes to deliver a high quality entertaining soundscape it's all fair game and that has caused some issues because I use samplers for the sampler is it's a keyboard is attached to essentially a digital recorder when you hit the key on the keyboard triggers this sounds at the playback and with keyboarding also triggers with sensitivity means that if I hit the key real hard still have a little more of a harder attack and you can vary pitch if I had to see note that has a sample and then I headed demon of the same sample it will be up a step so for seeing visit McGregor is still hopefully effective we could do without saying, in Atlanta one of my biggest problems was Roman rolling is a 2 km they have for chase boats following the rowers in heaven help and that's what they need to deliver the visual coverage of okay but the helicopter chase both just completely wash at the same so no matter how the microphones you cannot capture you cannot reach in isolate sound like ED vision the people have expectations and if you see the rowers they have a sound that there expected so what would that afternoon we went out on a canoe with a couple of rowers and recorded stereo samples of the different type of effects it would be somewhat typical of an event in the middle of those recordings into the sampler and play them back of the shots of the bouts published standby notarizing leaving this is victorious positive from the fairly first on the five sided dancing is out there in the early stages going we do almost racing looking to get some be running rentals often the most the way and occasionally you will come across for excessive pictures of the horses of the far side which is double from in order to encompass but you have engine noise in the case so if we would move the microbial mats will do there is the call routing out for me, and cussing so basically the way you cover lots of stuff is to run a tape which has the sound of horses is galloping which essentially remember rightly a slow down before charge and if voting hurdles you will have a tape which has the sound of somebody forwarding through hedge exposure: a trust level of time so as they go through moreover hopefully huddle you actually famous up and feel several to you very level a little bit so it sounds like several of his games are together that's pretty much a stunt same recording reviews.  Some horse racing event sound strange to make as a have this constant thundering sound and I can't tell if it's real or not it's like in horse racing movies like I did Seabiscuit and all hat I know you can hear the jockeys yelling and screaming at each other actually when they get tight on a turn here the webs gone I recorded an Arabian horse Arabians have a different state than thorough rights and I put for wireless microphones on each roof we wanted to control the speed or so we had their trainer run the horse in a circle with a rope we want to control the movement is with $12,000 in gear on the horse he did take one microphone off will I was in charge for the sound of a real event I would want to do like the Kentucky Derby and use Micah raise around the track and have some onboard mics and then have Mike's in the crowd and have fun like some of the horseracing fans they get really crazy when they're cheering those people are yelling they're not screaming at the top of their lungs yelling 16.so that funds that you know we like to have fun as well as an silver daisy use live the real sand of the doll hitting the boards triggers and samples only play around with kick drums that drums dustbins for you have erroneously defined that it ain't just adds a bit of fun really to attend did I get a bit repetitive one thing it's not real but is nonsense that something that I think most of his involved in sports trying to try and holds the experience we tread the middle road between most reliable summary plot if you're sitting at the side of the basketball court from the TV 28 the producers want to hear the ball is it goes through the net the solution of the net it has certainly something that you do not ever here in the basketball rate we only hear that on TV because this exciting Samuel L Jackson and Dr. her coach Carter the supervising sound editor wanted me to get down of the basketball what he wanted there's a pain pattern if you ever heard basketball when you bounce it goes bounce a kind has this high area ring we did this great rim stuff like rim slams rim hits net wishes to never try to capture the sound of this pain and we are right under the net and unlike now that's not it it just sounds a good big side of a basketball in the reverb in the room but then we went into the corner of the room and I got elevated on the bleachers and I had my microphone above the ball and the guy slammed the ball on the ground and then as the ball is coming up to my microphone you hear the ping I've always taken the approach to record the sounds documentary style like accurate and then I tried to then find the next level up to go heightened reality sometimes you actually have to cheat a sound even bigger to make it cut through the thing that Hollywood does differently is it sounds huge the movies sound big they sound rich it's definitely more theatrical than real just think fast and furious or diehard as we been doing this over the years sort of emulating broadcast and enhancing at the broadcasters have been listening to what we've been doing and then using our techniques back in the actual broadcasts was very interesting and ESPN we told him they would try to look at your broadcast model detritus of capture that classic broadcast thing and then they told us what we like to be playing your game and we really love the fact that you guys know push up the bushes on the bats is what they do now in broadcast of the axes of those sounds up meaning that you would elicit a baseball game now loses 10 years ago he said he's big that wishes an arm throws a big fat catch of it because they have Mike's located very close To those sound many years ago the only other people to being used expected much whipping the rabbis and that will whereas now they expect to hear every kick every runs every Muslim referee is that they can use the hearing on video games films of the has dubbed so we're always trying to make sense of the same the challenge from these can export some TVs engaging consumer video games if we don't lose out this a challenge I welcome I'm gearing up for London 2012 with the gays be presented in high definition picture and certainly in surroundsound I'll be pushing to create the best most involving most detailed sound ever at the Olympics and one thing that makes very happy to hear that the diseases will be
