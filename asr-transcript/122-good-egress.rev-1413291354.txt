When designing a commercial structure, the architect must make the hallways wide enough for a wheelchair. 
The materials must be compatible with surrounding climate, the beams must be able to support the building and withstand the wind.
The building should be dynamic, interesting, comfortable, and ready to be completely abandoned if it burns.
There are a number of considerations for how a building should respond to emergency.
Horns, versus strobes, versus speakers; the pulsating frequency of the light; the intensity of the light; smoke dampening, it goes on and on.
There's the sprinklers, the panic bars, you know the spring-loaded horizontal bar that you push to unlock emergency exit; the smoke detectors, what kinds you use in the distances between them.
You know, a lot of people hardly even look up and see these things and they just need to be there when an emergency happens.
Now, Adam Winick and Daniel Scoville are architects.
We work with them at Arxon in beautiful downtown Oakland California.
Most the time when they're working on fire safety they'll consult experts about where to place what kinds of architectural emergency devices, but there's one safety device that they must design right into the building from the get-go.
It's impossible to ignore.
As far as stair locations that's pretty important right from the start because it changes the whole dynamic of your space.
Typically buildings require two fire stairs but it all depends on the size and purpose of the structure.
In architecture and building codes you always need a certain number of exits or means of egress, so ways out of building, and this fire escape precariously bolted to the side of building is one of our means of egress out of the space.
This is how 99% invisible is gonna escape a burning building.
This is how Arxon and 99% invisible is going to escape a burning building. 
In case of fire architects Daniel Scoville and Adam Winick and producer Avery Trautman, would put their steely resolve and athletic prowess to the test.
There is this classic wrought iron fire escape right outside our window, and I thought it was defunct.
It's all rusty and stuff, but then I bothered to read the sign with the evacuation plan for our building.
Always read the evacuation plan.
Fire escapes are not allowed in new construction, but because we are in a beautiful old brick building, the fire escape is actually one of our means of egress.
We just speak of means of egress thinking of the whole route: the corridor and the stairs and you think of an exit as being essentially the door.
Professor Sarah Lemuel independent scholarly research at MIT.
One of my books is called the fireproof building.
And I can't remember the subtitle.
It's the fireproof building - technology and public safety in the 19th century American city. 
The single most dangerous thing architecture historically is fire and in the 1700's, if a fire did break out, there wasn't a whole lot you can do about it.
By that time there were firefighters whom you summoned by yelling loudly and they would come and they would bring you, the fire escape. 
It was a cart with a ladder on it.
That was actually what the earliest fire escapes were.
So fire escape methods started to get incorporated into architecture starting with the scuttle. 
It looked like a skylight.
It would have some kind of over.
It was like a trap door on the roof and then there'd be a ladder to get up and out.
And so in a fire would climb through the scuttle, out onto the roof, hop to your neighbor scuttle, and crawl into their building which presumably hadn't also caught fire.
That was the beginning, this idea that the city could require something for the sake of fire safety.
Around 1860, New York begins to require means of egress in tenement buildings.
Tenement buildings were tall, flammable, densely packed tinderbox just full of families.
So of course landlord went with the least expensive options. 
The popular cheap fix was rope. 
Ropes with baskets that you're supposed to somehow you know; the buildings on fire, you have your kid, you're terrified and you calmly open this, this little nightstand, pullout the basket with the ropes; you know, set up the apparatus, strap yourself in, and somehow, you know, lower yourself calmly to the ground, you know it is just preposterous.
There are these hilarious old advertisements for fake cabinets, and hollowed refrigerators and empty washing machines so that you can store your ropes and basket apparatus, because no one would notice that extra washing machine. 
One engineer actually thought that instead of dispatching ropes from inside, archers could shoot the ropes up the higher floors.
You know, people aren't that athletic necessarily to begin with but second of all, it's a fire.
You know, this isn't the best time, you know to like, figure out how to lower yourself on a rope.
Another patent proposed individual parachute hats with accompanying rubber shoes to break the fall.
There are also these big slide fire escapes that were largely marketed the schools as both emergency devices and playground equipment.
There actually used to be a giant spiral slide to escape the Claremont Hotel right here in Oakland, which what made that plays a lot better.
There were lots of ideas but by the 1870's fire escapes begin becoming something iron, something fixed to the building, although by that point they still weren't anything great they were like iron platform outside of the window with straight ladders attached or it might just be a straight ladder clamped to the wall.
In some cities the external ladders angled and widened to become more like stairs.
This was an improvement of course, but ultimately fire escapes just didn't suffice and it took a terrible tragedy to show this.
So the Asch building in New York was built as a loft building and its owners represented it as being, you know, maybe for warehousing not necessarily for manufacturing.
Based on its dimensions, the Asch building was required to have three means egress but the developer insisted that the property would just be used as warehousing. So rather than three stairs, he was allowed to put in two stairs and a thin fire escape.
Then the owner rents the top three floors of the Asch building to the triangle shirtwaist Company.
In March of 1911, there's a fire in the building.
It's not known exactly how begins and it, it, it spreads quickly.
The 10th floor has an exit to the roof so many that can floor workers are able to survive by taking the stairs up.
And the workers on the eighth floor are by and large able to get out.
The workers on the ninth floor were trapped.
The doors of the stairs opened inward and became blocked with bodies and the stairs backed up with workers exiting from the floors below so the workers on the ninth floor couldn't get down.
Only a few workers on the floor knew about the 10th floor exit and so they didn't even try to go upstairs.
There was charge that one of the doors was locked and this wasn't proved of the trial, but I believe he had been with all the people exiting from the eighth floor and staircases were very narrow and winding, there just wasn't the capacity.
Some workers tried to use the outside fire escape and it collapsed under the weight.
It was from the windows of the ninth floor that many workers desperate to escape the flames and smoke fell or jump to their deaths.
One hundred and fourty six people lost their lives right in the middle of Greenwich Village; there were a lot of witnesses; it was horrible. 
But the building was fine.
The Asch building was a fireproof building and of course it's still standing and it's now part of New York University.
The Asch building, now called the brown building was well-made, which is why at the time, no one really thought it needed egress.
Exits and egress were a problem, people fought for the tenants and the poor quality buildings.
The logic was in the building was first class it was in and of itself safe for the occupants and then the people could this be safely locked inside of these noncombustible buildings.
The triangle fire proved that architecture couldn't protect us; we had to protect ourselves from architecture.
This is when an organization called the National Fire Protection Association does a lot of studies and thinking you know about egress.
A good egress meant getting rid of fire escapes for so many reasons.
They weren't commonly used so they were often out of order in states of disrepair.
In northern climates they were covered with snow or eroded by rain, and not everyone can access them like people disabilities and the very young and elderly and women who are hamstrung by the fashion of the time.
Women in these long skirts might not have the presence of mind to take off their skirt so they could actually get out.
Also fire escapes are scary.
You see some narrow rickety staircases on really tall buildings that make you feel like you should strap on rubber shoes and a parachute hat. 
And if people weren't used to using fire escapes they often didn't know where they were.
People try to leave the way they came in, you know, that that's they think of.
And that's where modern fire escapes come in. 
They're not bolted to the side of the building.
They are the logical place where you would go in an emergency; they are the stairs.
While they look like normal stairs but really they're pieces of emergency equipment enclosing fireproof walls and sealed with a self-closing door and covered with sprinklers and alarms.
And because they work perfectly well as stairways, they're often the stairway in a building so the building won't have the grand stairway any longer, it'll have a lot of elevators and the fire stairs.
Goodbye opulent lobbies with sweeping grand stairways.
If you like to take the stairs you probably already bemoaned the fact that they are always shoved off into a tower and are very cold and industrial matter what the building looks like from the outside.
If we want we can make them look good but most clients elect to spend money on things that people are going to see more.
Office mate and architect Adam Winick again, the stairways need to be whats called rated, meaning that they need to be enclosed in a type of construction that won't melt or allow the fire to penetrate as quickly as a non-rated wall. 
These rated towers can be like buildings within buildings, the prime example of a souped-up fire stairway is an freedom Tower.
The freedom Tower which has this emergency core which is on its own separate electrical and plumbing system and has its own elevator, its own stairs.
That's Elijah Huge, he's a professor at Wesleyan University.
And I'm also a practicing architect and I run a small firm called Periferie Projects and part of that periferie involves doing research on architecture in emergency.
He's particularly fascinated by these core structures around the fire stairs. 
And the emergency cores are modeled with software and simulations deticated solely to egress.
This program Exodus 4.0, I think there's Exodus 5.0, can simulate how quickly a floor of a building can be cleared based on the maximum number of bodies that would be allowed in the space; how quickly could these bodies exit the space.
So the architect, or actually more likely the consultant, will plug in the measurements of the building, all the information about emergency equipment, maximum number of occupants and basically click play and watch the digital people escape the pixel flames.
A lot of agent-based modeling programs with humans don't work terribly well because humans don't necessarily behave predictably but in emergencies they do.
Given adequate signage, people will behave in predictable ways in the event of an emergency.
So this makes sense we've already established that in an emergency people don't want to go places they having gone to before, or use devices that never seen, or you know, figure out if they can catch a rope shot at them with a bow and arrow.
The way egress works now is in keeping with the way that we use buildings normally.
Even though rated towers take up a lot of space and money and make for an unpleasant stepping experience, it's hard to argue with this solution.
It's paid off let's say; Sara Wormyll again, for 2012 in nonresidential structures there were 65 deaths in the whole year.
You know, probably more people were struck by lightning.
Actually 28 people were struck by lightning in 2012.
But still even though each one is a tragedy, 65 best doesn't strike me as all that many. 
This number is already down from 2003 where there were 220 deaths in nonresidential buildings, so these are the buildings with heavy regulations and core structures.
Modern emergency equipment and egress procedures are really helping to minimize the effects of fire accidents, but from an aesthetic standpoint it's almost a pity because fire escapes are beautiful.
And although I'm not really thrilled at the prospect of clambering down the fire escape outside my window, I do like to look it. 
And for Sara Wormyll, fire escapes, even ones are no longer in use of his physical reminder that we evolved past being a culture that says here's a rope, good luck buddy.
I just like seeing them and hope that they'll be preserved because it just makes me realize how we kind of have to work together as a society, you have to rely on other people to put in the stairs to follow the rules for the rules to be there and that's what makes us safe.
