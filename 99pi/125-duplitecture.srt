1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,500
[Roman Mars] This is 99% Invisible. I'm Roman Mars.

2
00:00:06,250 --> 00:00:09,250
The best knock-offs in the world are in China.

3
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,250
Sure, designer handbags and Rolexes,

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:16,250
but also really large-scale imitations, like fake Apple Stores

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,250
that are so dead-on

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:21,750
that employees of the store think they're working in a real Apple Store.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,000
But beyond just working in knock-offs,

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,500
many residents of Chinese suburbs live their lives in replica cities.

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Venice's with complete canals and replicas of the Doge's Palace.

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,750
Paris's with Eiffel Towers and Arc de Triomphes.

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,750
There are Chrysler Buildings, Sydney Opera Houses.

12
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,750
[Bianca Bosker] Driving through the suburbs of any city in China,

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:48,500
you will find a plethora of fake Versailles, British developments,

14
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:51,250
and Californias all bumping up side-by-side.

15
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:57,750
Just Shanghai itself has ten cities all built in the architectural style of different European countries,

16
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,000
so it's possible to travel from Germany, to Italy,

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
to London in the course of a few hours,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,250
provided there's not too much traffic.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,000
[Roman Mars] Bianca Bosker is the author of the book Original Copies:

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,250
Architectural Mimicry in Contemporary China. And she coined a term

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,250
for these buildings: Duplitecture.

22
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:23,250
[Bianca Bosker] Duplitecture refers to this nationwide movement taking place in China,

23
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:28,000
whereby people are copying entire cities and towns from Europe

24
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,250
and the United States. lifesize or sometimes even bigger

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,000
than lifesize. These are not theme parks;

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,250
duplitecture developments are actually living, breathing communities

27
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,750
where Chinese families are raising their children,

28
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,750
living out their lives in a place that looks like Orange County

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
or Paris, but it’s smack dab in the middle of the People’s Republic.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,250
[Roman Mars] These buildings are not just novelties, like the Pyramid

31
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,250
or the Eiffel Tower in Las Vegas.

32
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,750
[Bianca Bosker] The biggest private property developer in China told me

33
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,750
that two-thirds of their residential developments are being built in the European style.

34
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:03,500
[Roman Mars] Nor are they like American Chinatowns or Germantowns

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,000
which were established by immigrants. These are Chinese communities,

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,500
in American or European style buildings,

37
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:13,000
which are often designed by Chinese architects.

38
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:18,500
[Bianca Bosker] Visiting China’s copy of Paris in the outskirts of Hangzhou,

39
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,500
I found a place that was in some ways very emblematic of Paris.

40
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,000
You have the Eiffel Tower, you have the Champs-Élysées square,

41
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,750
but there was no new architecture.

42
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,500
[Roman Mars] Meaning the Chinese weren’t interested in duplicating the newer buildings of Paris,

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,000
just the old, classic looking ones that are iconic of the city.

44
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,750
[Bianca Bosker] At the same time, this is the most brand-new, sparkling Paris

45
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,250
that I’ve ever seen.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,750
[Roman Mars] Even though these are intended to be copies,

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
it’s pretty much impossible to plop a building onto a completely new environment without modifying it a little,

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
or a lot. Oftentimes the duplitecture is larger or smaller

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,500
than the real thing. Or different elements,

50
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
or features might be bloated bigger than others.

51
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,000
Sometimes duplitecture gets so twisted and warped,

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
until it’s a freakish caricature of the original.

53
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,750
[Bianca Bosker] One of the interesting twists on this architectural movement has been the creation of mega-highrises,

54
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,000
that are built in a Baroque or a Neoclassical style.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,500
Picture Versailles stretched 20 floors into the air,

56
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,750
and you’ll have some idea of what’s going on.

57
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,750
[Roman Mars] Developers can take a lot of liberties with duplitecture construction,

58
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,500
like making the replicas work in accordance with Feng Shui,

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,750
but nonetheless, a lot of these duplitecture compounds have rules

60
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,750
that actively discourage any type of modification

61
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,750
that they think might subvert the simulacrum.

62
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:50,750
[Bianca Bosker] They have very strict rules in place to ensure that Chinese elements,

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
or foreign elements, don’t crop in

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,250
and spoil the impression of a Paris.

65
00:03:56,250 --> 00:04:01,750
And these rules have been set up to preserve the European feel of this development.

66
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:05,000
For example, no hanging laundry outside; no changing the paint;

67
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,500
no installing air conditioners; no keeping chickens in the back yard.

68
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,000
[Roman Mars] To further create the impression of Paris,

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,750
there might be a French bakery or a Bastille Day celebration.

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,000
There might be a pub in an Irish town,

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,250
or a real canal network in a knockoff Venice. As odd and uncanny

72
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,250
as these buildings and communities can be,

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:27,250
duplitecture is pretty impressive. These buildings go up quickly,

74
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:31,000
on a massive scale, and they show no signs of stopping.

75
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,500
Bosker saw new developments popping up around China all the time.

76
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,250
But duplitecture is not exactly a new trend.

77
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,750
[Bianca Bosker] They have a lot of practice doing this.

78
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:46,000
In premodern China you had China’s imperial rulers using copycat buildings

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,250
as a way of showing off their power and establishing their authority.

80
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,500
In the third century B.C.,

81
00:04:51,500 --> 00:05:00,000
one of the rulers showed off his conquest of a rival kingdom by recreating their buildings within his own capital city.

82
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,250
[Roman Mars] You’d also have imperial hunting parks,

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,000
where rulers would import flora

84
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,750
and fauna of all kinds to recreate known landscapes within their own domain.

85
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,750
[Bianca Bosker] These imperial rulers would copy as a way of showing

86
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,750
that they could literally move heaven and earth.

87
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,000
They now possessed this foreign building or place; it was theirs.

88
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,250
[Roman Mars] And in keeping with that tradition,

89
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:26,250
one of the most copied buildings in China is the very seat of Western power itself.

90
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,250
[Bianca Bosker] The White House is generally credited

91
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,500
as being the most copied building in China.

92
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:40,500
And it’s used for everything from hotels to restaurants to courthouses to homes.

93
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,250
[Roman Mars] Just like the White House has a china collection,

94
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,750
China has a White House collection.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,750
The different Chinese White Houses serve different purposes,

96
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:51,500
so they’ve morphed into various permutations.

97
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:54,000
But they all have the signature columns

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,500
and square portico built in the true blue unique style,

99
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,750
wholly original to the U.S. of A.

100
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:04,000
[Bianca Bosker] I hate to break it to everyone, but that’s not an original building.

101
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,250
The architect

102
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:13,000
who built the White House based his design on a huge building in Dublin

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,500
that is now the seat of the parliament of Ireland.

104
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,000
[Roman Mars] The Leinster House in Dublin,

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,250
which in turn has elements of classical Greek and Roman architecture,

106
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:25,750
and it pretty much looks like the White House even

107
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:27,750
though it’s kind of gray. It’s the gray house.

108
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,750
[Bianca Bosker] The founding fathers were really into duplitecture as well.

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:34,750
They were their own form of architectural plagiarists.

110
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,250
[Roman Mars] And this is so obvious if you’ve ever seen the buildings

111
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:41,250
that Thomas Jefferson designed. They were also covered in columns.

112
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,750
He based the Virginia state capitol on this ancient Roman temple, and

113
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,500
that also has gone on, in turn,

114
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,250
to influence the design of many many state capitols around the country.

115
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:57,500
[Bianca Bosker] Some of the greatest hits of American architecture are copies of the greatest hits of ancient Roman architecture,

116
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:01,500
which are now all being copied by the Chinese.

117
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:05,250
[Roman Mars] So we did it too. North America was ruled by Europeans,

118
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,750
so it makes sense

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,000
that we would have more European style architecture lying around.

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,750
But we still continue to build these European homages today.

121
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:17,000
[Bianca Bosker] When Americans build McMansions or buildings

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,500
that draw from European elements, we’re being inspired.

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:26,000
When the Chinese do so, they’re ripping off; they’re copying,

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,500
they’re con artists. And I think that’s unfair.

125
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,750
Maybe we should recognize that

126
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,250
what we’re all doing is copying some pretty old buildings

127
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,500
because we still find them attractive and we still think

128
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,750
that they have symbolic significance to our everyday lives.

129
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:45,500
[Roman Mars] It’s easy to scoff at knockoffs of Venice,

130
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:49,000
but these warped mimicries are the start of something new.

131
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
I say this all the time:

132
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:56,500
Stealing plus lack of talent equals creativity. What I mean there is

133
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,250
that in the effort to copy something, your skills or lack of skills

134
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,000
or different experience mutates the original so

135
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,500
that very often you come up with something that is completely new

136
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,500
and completely yours. Copying is totally underrated.

137
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:16,500
And your mindful iteration is how good things become great things.

138
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,750
[Bianca Bosker] China has actually proven quite successful at turning copies into innovation.

139
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:24,500
If you look at the Shen Zhai movement in China,

140
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:30,250
which is this name given for copies of the iPhone, of sneakers,

141
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,750
of social networks -- what you find is

142
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,500
that oftentimes the copies improve on the original in certain ways.

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,500
China’s iPhone knockoff, which I believe is called the Sciphone,

144
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:46,000
actually had some features you couldn’t find on Apple’s phone.

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You have a removable battery, multiple SIM cards, all of these things

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,500
that Apple users really wanted and coveted.

147
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,500
And here you could find it in this knockoff phone.

148
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:02,750
I’m personally fascinated to see how China takes its imitation

149
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,750
and turns it into innovation.

150
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,500
[Roman Mars] 99% Invisible was produced this week by Avery Trufelman with Katie Mingle,

151
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Sam Greenspan, and me, Roman Mars.

152
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,500
We are a project of 91.7 local public radio, KALW in San Francisco,

153
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,500
and produced by the offices of Arcsine,

154
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,000
a comprehensive architectural firm, in beautiful downtown Oakland, California.

155
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,750
Speaking of our dear East Bay,

156
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:54,250
yours truly was named best local radio host of the Best in the East Bay edition of the East Bay Express.

157
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,750
That totally made my day. Thanks, guys.

158
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:01,000
99% Invisible is made possible by our often imitated

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
but never duplicated listeners, and by TinyLetter, email

160
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,500
for people with something to say. My boy Maslow has something to say.

161
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,750
What have you got to say, Maslow?

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
[Maslow] Ultron is cooler than Iron Man.

163
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,250
[Roman Mars] Yeah, but Ultron is evil.

165
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,500
Yeah, and evil (...) .

166
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,750
[Roman Mars] TinyLetter.com is free, easy, minimal, and powerful.

167
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,750
It’s the simplest way to send an email newsletter.

168
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,000
From the great people behind Mailchimp.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,500
This program is also made possible by the music we play during each episode.

170
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:32,500
Really, this show would be terrible without music.

171
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,500
The song you’re hearing right

172
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,750
now is 401 Circuit by Toronto’s own I Am a Robot and Proud.

173
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,750
This is from the Uphill City album,

174
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:43,250
but there’s also a new album called Touchtone. It’s great

175
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:46,750
and priced to move on Bandcamp. They have a link on our website.

176
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:50,250
Plus, be sure to check out all of our regular favorites. Melodium

177
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,500
and Set in Sand from the labels Abandoned Building and Audio Dregs,

178
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:58,250
Okay [inaudible]. Keegan DeWitt is amazing

179
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,000
and scores tons of our shows.

180
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,250
And our new friends at Ghostly International release electronic music

181
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,750
that we love to ruin by talking all over it.

182
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,750
There are too many to mention here,

183
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,000
but we keep lists with links on all our episode pages.

184
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,750
If you want to feel instantly great, today, support a musician

185
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:19,000
that you love. These guys are a good place to start.

186
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:23,750
We are a founding member of Radiotopia from PRX. It’s the all killer,

187
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,500
no filler radio storytelling collective.

188
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:28,250
This week on Benjamin Walker’s Theory of Everything,

189
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,000
if you’re looking for a good book to read this summer,

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
you can try to do what Phyllis Rose did.

191
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,750
She picked a shelf at the library, at random,

192
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,500
and read every book on it.

193
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,000
[Phyllis Rose] I am talking about reading for yourself, choosing your own reading,

194
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,500
and choosing it even arbitrarily,

195
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:49,250
as an extreme way of asserting your freedom.

196
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
[Roman Mars] Benjamin Walker’s Theory of Everything.

197
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,250
It’s just one of seven amazing shows from Radiotopia.

198
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,500

The 99PI experience isn’t just this episode that you’re hearing,

202
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,250
we’re also fascinating on Twitter. You can follow us @RomanMars,
