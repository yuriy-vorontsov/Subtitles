[Roman Mars]
This is 99% invisible. I'm Roman Mars. This sound is unmistakable.

[Katie Mingle]
Maybe you find it kind of lulling, like I do,
since it signifies the end of a trip to the grocery store.
You found all the things on your list and
now you get to just stand there and zone out for a second
or flip through a gossip magazine
while the checkout person does the work.

[Roman Mars]
That's our new producer, Katie Mingle. I myself find
that sound a bit anxiety inducing
since it's also the sound of the total
that I'm going to have to pay going up, and up, and up, and up.

[George Laurer]
When I go to the grocery store and check out I'm utterly amazed at
how well the scanners can read barcodes.
Now I don't tell the checkout people--my wife always did--"My husband here is the one
that invented that barcode." They just kind of look at you as
if to say, 'Yeah, I believe that.
'" Of course today they would look at you as if to say,
"You mean there was a time they didn't have a barcode?"

[Roman Mars]
It's hard to imagine now, a world without barcodes,
a world without George Laurer.

[George Laurer]
Well, hello. I'm George J. Laurer. I'm the one
that invented the UPC barcode and symbol in 1973.

[Katie Mingle]
Some of you might be saying to yourselves,
"I thought Joseph Woodland invented the barcode."

[Roman Mars]
And if you are saying that to yourself, you are a nerd and I love you
for it. Just hold your nerd horses
because we're getting to Woodland right now.

[Katie Mingle]

It started the way a lot of things started with people trying to make more money.


[George Laurer]
The grocery business decided
that they needed some way to reduce their overhead.

[Katie Mingle]

One of the main places they felt they were losing money was the checkout line.


[George Laurer]
They came up with the idea of having some kind of a scannable code.

[Katie Mingle]
Which would move people more quickly through the line.
One of the first people
that started working on it was an engineer named Joseph Woodland.
After working on the Manhattan Project,
Woodland moved on to develop an innovative way to produce elevator music.
He was jamming on this project probably set to make a whole bunch of money until--and this is according to Woodland's New York Times obituary--his father forbid him from getting into the industry
because it was controlled by the mob.

[Roman Mars]
So Woodland moved on from elevator music to barcodes.

[Katie Mingle]
He was trying to come up with a symbol that
when scanned would translate to a series of numbers
that a computer could use to identify a product.
So one day he's sitting on the beach in Miami, Florida.

[Roman Mars]
So the legend goes.

[Katie Mingle]
And Woodland's thinking about his days in the Boy Scouts
and morse code.

[Roman Mars]
As one tends to do on the beach.

[Katie Mingle]
And he's kind of absentmindedly drawing in the sand with his fingers
when suddenly he looks down and he's got it.

[Roman Mars]

He's dragged his four fingers through the sand in the shape of concentric circles.


[Katie Mingle]
Instead of dot, dot, dot, dash, dash, dash he thinks,
"I can use skinny and wide lines."

[Roman Mars]
Bullseye.

[Katie Mingle]
Bullseye. The very first barcodes were in the shape of a bullseye.
Actually, they didn't call them barcodes yet.
Woodland's invention was called a classifying apparatus and method.

[Roman Mars]
I'm really glad that we don't call them that anymore. That was 1948,
and then for about 20 years the bullseye idea gathered dust.
The scanners
and other equipment needed to put the system in place were just too expensive
for any of it to be feasible.

[Katie Mingle]
Fast forward to 1973. The technology is now a bit more affordable
and a group of supermarket executives led by a guy named Alan Haberman are like,
"Okay, barcode or bust. We're doing this." By
that time there were a few other designs out there
but none were perfect. So they put together a list of qualities
that their ideal barcode would have
and asked 14 different companies to come up with a proposal.

[George Laurer]
It could be no larger than 1-and-a-half square inches.
It had to have a big enough depth of field
that could read about a foot-and-a-half above the scanner.
It had to be omnidirectional.

[Katie Mingle]
That's George Laurer again. He was working at IBM at the time
which was one of the companies competing to make the best barcode.

[Roman Mars]
And most people thought
that a circular design like Woodland's would probably work best
because of the way the scanners worked.

[George Laurer]
In those days just about every scanner was a single line,
and you can just picture that. If you had a single line
and it was going in the direction of the bar it would not read all the bars.


[Katie Mingle]
Woodland's original circular design solved this
because it could be read from any direction.
That meant the checkout person didn't have to take your bag of Cheetos
and turn it just the right way before it could pass over the scanner.

[Roman Mars]
But George didn't think the bullseye symbol would work.

[George Laurer]
I couldn't support that as the solution to
what the grocery industry wanted because to me there was no way
that it would fulfill their specifications.
My integrity just would not let me come up with a bunch of bull.

[Katie Mingle]
So George went back to the drawing table.

[George Laurer]
My wife said I came back and I would work on it day and night
and come back at night. Again, most of this was thinking, arithmetic,
trying to prove that this would work. Also,
I have to admit I had to disprove
that some of the others wouldn't work.

[Katie Mingle]
He ultimately came up with a rectangular barcode
that fit more code into less space which was crucial
since grocery manufacturers were already grumbling about having to make room
for this new symbol on their packaging.
But there was still the issue of the one-line scanner.

[George Laurer]
Somehow we got the idea that if we used an X for the scan pattern,
which could be developed very easily with a pair of mirrors.

[Katie Mingle]
Then the barcode be read by the scanner no matter
which way it was oriented as it passed.

[Roman Mars]
So even
though Woodland came up with the original idea of using lines of various widths,
George Laurer did more than just change
that shape from a circle to a rectangle. He improved on that symbol,
the code behind the symbol, and the scanners that read the symbol.
Even Joe Woodland thought so.

[George Laurer]
Joe Woodland was very enthusiastic. He worked with me. In fact,
he wrote the actual proposal
for the submission to the grocery industry,
but it was my invention of the particular symbol and barcode
that we see today.

[Katie Mingle]
The Symbol Selection Committee unanimously voted
for George Laurer's rectangular symbol and code.
They called it the universal product code, or UPC.
A year later in 1974 a pack of Wrigley's chewing gum became the first item to ever be scanned with the UPC barcode.


[Sanjay Sarma]
If barcodes hadn't been invented the entire layout
and architecture of commerce would've been different.
The impacts are very difficult to overestimate.
My name is Sanjay Sarma.
I'm a professor of mechanical engineering at MIT.

[Katie Mingle]
Sanjay has also worked with an organization called GS1. That stands
for Global Standards 1.
If you need a barcode on your product you have to go through GS1 to get it.


[Sanjay Sarma]
Imagine if telephone numbers weren't standardized.
Two people can have the same phone number. You need standards.

[Roman Mars]

When barcodes became the standard they didn't just make checkout lines faster.
They allowed stores to keep track of huge amounts of inventory
and to collect data on what we were buying,
data they could use to keep us coming back for more.
Without barcodes...

[Sanjay Sarma]
Superstores might not exist. But, equally,
a small store might need more employees to run it.
It's like the grease that makes the machine run.
It's one of the key elements of efficiency in our capitalistic system.


[Roman Mars]
And when you put it like that you can see why
for some people the barcode has come to represent everything they hate about capitalism
and consumerism.

[commercial]
You can get wrapped candies of every kind: bubble gum, lollipops,
fun-sized candy bars, just $1.89.

[Roman Mars]
When I was a punk kid
if a band's album had a barcode on it we knew they were complete sellouts.


It's not the barcode's fault but it's become the symbol
or the glyph of technology we're afraid of or don't understand,
or being a cog in a wheel in a larger monolithic machine, the matrix,
if you will.

[Roman Mars]
Oh, I will, Jerry Whiting.

[Jerry Whiting]
My name is Jerry Whiting.
I am the founder of Azalea Software here in Seattle, Washington.
I've been writing software that prints barcodes for 25 years now.
They aren't bad, they aren't good, they're just tools.
But most people look at them and don't even know where to start.

[Roman Mars]
So let's demystify for a minute and look at what's inside the barcode.
Again, what we're talking about here is the UPC barcode
that George Laurer invented. This is the barcode that you and I
and everyone in the world has had the most interaction with.

[Katie Mingle]
The UPC barcode is divided into two halves.
It's actually two barcodes sitting right next to each other.
You can see this visually because there are these longer bars
that come down in the middle and on each side.
Those are called the guard bars. The guard bars tell the scanner
that the code is starting and ending.

[Jerry Whiting]
The left half of the barcode tells you who the manufacturer is
and the right half tells you which particular product it is.

[Katie Mingle]
And this was something I didn't realize.
The scanner is reading both the white and the dark lines.

[George Laurer]
To understand the scanner, just consider yourself in a dark room
where the wall behind has bars painted on it
and you took a flashlight
and shined it over your head across the bars.
You would see the room get a little lighter
when you were over the light bars and it would get dark
when it was over the dark bars.

[Roman Mars]
Black lines
that don't reflect the laser light back to the scanner register
as a one. White lines equal zero.
There are actually 95 evenly spaced columns on a UPC barcode.
I think black line is actually a bunch of ones right next to each other.
The computer adds all of that together
and you get a string of 12 numbers.

[George Laurer]
This number goes the computer. The computer
now looks up in its table to get the information such as
what is the product, how much they're charging for it, but
that is not in the barcode. The only thing that's in the barcode is
where the computer should look.

[Katie Mingle]

This number is also printed below the barcode just in case the scanner isn't working,
which for me really makes the whole mystery a little anticlimactic.
I mean, it's right there.

[Jerry Whiting]
So when most people
until recently thought of barcodes they thought of something
that was a combination of bars and stripes. More recently,
two-dimensional barcodes, which look like crossword puzzles,
have emerged, the most popular being QR barcodes, quick response,
that are scanned by cellphones.

[Roman Mars]
We've all seen these
and maybe a few of us have actually bothered to pull out our cellphones
and download the app required to scan them.

[Katie Mingle]
Yeah, there's something about them that I find kind of lame
or annoying. It's like, "No, Chilli's,
I don't want more information on the blooming onion."

[Roman Mars]
Well, if you did you might know
that the blooming onion is from Outback.

[Katie Mingle]
Anyway, I googled: why are QR codes lame.
I got a bunch of articles basically saying they're actually really useful.
They're just being misused.

[Roman Mars]
Mostly by advertisers
who just started slapping them on every single thing.

[Katie Mingle]
But Jerry Whiting, he still believes in them.

[Jerry Whiting]

The nice thing about QR barcodes is they are not just a lookup number to an external database.
Yes, it can be a chunk of text. It can be a URL,
it can be a whole of different things,
but there is no central authority that tells you what or
how to do anything.

[Katie Mingle]
Meaning you don't have to go through GS1 to get a QR code,
which lets people do stuff like make a giant picture of Amy Goodman's face entirely out of QR codes.


[???]
This is my QR code Amy Goodman portrait made with 2,
304 unique QR codes that link to nine years of Democracy Now videos.

[Roman Mars]
Besides the QR codes, Laurer
and Woodland's original barcodes have spawned a bunch of other barcodes.
They're used for all sorts of things.

[Katie Mingle]
There's code 128 which is mostly used for packaging and shipping.
There's post net which is used by the post office to sort mail.
There are barcodes that use radio frequencies to send out data.
They're called RFID tags and they aren't really barcodes at all.
They just get put in the same category
because like barcodes they're being used to keep track of inventory.

[Roman Mars]

With a grocery cart full of RFID tagged items one could conceivably wheel their cart through a big hoop
that would read all the contents all at once,
basically eliminating the checkout line entirely
and allowing more people to pass through stores even more quickly so
that we can all buy more stuff.

[Katie Mingle]
Barcodes help us keep track of prescriptions, library books, luggage,
endangered animals. There are so many barcodes on so many things
that according to Jerry Whiting...

[Jerry Whiting]

When future archeologists come across remnants of our backward ass civilization
and they stumble across the barcode they're going to assign it religious significance
if they don't understand the supply chain.

[George Laurer]
We had no idea how far it was going to go. We
though it would stay just within the grocery industry.

[Roman Mars]
Of course, it didn't just stay in the grocery industry.
It actually went way beyond that, all the way to conspiracy.
There is in fact a silly conspiracy theory
that all barcodes have the number of the beast, 666,
encoded into them.

[Katie Mingle]
Yeah, it has to do with those guard bars that come at the beginning,
middle, and end of every barcode. And it's basically true
that there are three sixes codes into the guard bars. The answer to
why is a bit technical.
You can read about it on George Laurer's personal website in the FAQ section
if you want, but as exhibit B I submit George himself.

[George Laurer]
Well, hello. I'm George J. Laurer.

[Katie Mingle]

After we were done with our interview he was talking a little bit more about his job at IBM.


[George Laurer]
When I'd come home at night I'm like, "Oh, I've had a tough day.
" My poor wife was taking care of four kids.

[Katie Mingle]
And then he started talking about his wife and his kids.

[George Laurer]
She had the hard job, believe me. She gave up her career,
which was a teaching career, in order to take care of the kids.
Believe me, we are so proud of those kids. You just couldn't ask
for better kids. This is
because my wife spent her career raising those kids. I'm just
so lucky.

[Katie Mingle]
So does that sound like a satan worshipper to you guys?

[George Laurer]
My daughter has a bachelor's degree.

In Michael Lewis's new book,
which is all about high frequency trading computers,
he basically figured it out through the help of his characters
how signals travel around New York. It turns out
that they have their own kind of byways and thoroughfares. He says
that trading signal
that originated in Lower Manhattan went up the Westside highway
and out the Lincoln Tunnel to the other side to Weehawken, New Jersey
where there was this really particular changing called that's the high frequency traders loved.
The geography of the fiberoptic lines ends up shaping the way
that the entire stock market works.
