This is 99% invisible arm Roman Mars this sound is on the state may be kind of lulling

00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:42,250
Heidi signifies the end of the trip to the grocery store is handling things in your list

3
00:00:42,250 --> 
and you get to just stand than going out

4
 --> 
as part of the 2019 on the checkout person does the work that's our new producer Katie mingle I myself find

5
 --> 
that sounds amid anxiety inducing

6
 --> 
since it's also the sound of the total

7
 --> 
that I'm going to have to pay going what I go to the grocery store

8
 --> 
and check out I utterly amazed at

9
 --> 
how well the skaters can read barcodes

10
 --> 
though I don't tell the checkout people my wife always did get my husband here is one

11
 --> 
that invented

12
 --> 
that barcode labels got a look at Joseph to say you believe

13
 --> 
that course today they would look at you as

14
 --> 
if to say you mean there was a time they didn't have a barcode it's hard to imagine a world without bark of a world without George Moore hello George J Laura

15
 --> 
and the one that invented the UPC barcode and symbol in 1972 through

16
 --> 
now some of the 90 saying to yourselves on Joseph Woodland invented the barcode

17
 --> 
if you say that to yourself you are a nerd and I love you

18
 --> 
for it does hold your nerd horses because were getting to

19
 --> 
what went right

20
 --> 
now it started away a lot of things to people trying to make more money the grocery business decided

21
 --> 
that they needed some way to reduce their overhead one of the main places they felt they were losing was the checkout line

22
 --> 
that came up for the idea of having some kind of a scalable code

23
 --> 
which would move people more quickly through the line one of the first people decided working on it with engineer named Joseph woodland

24
 --> 
after working in the Manhattan project woodland moved on to develop innovative way 50s elevator music is jamming on this project probably sent to make a whole bunch of money Intel

25
 --> 
and is according to live in New York Times obituary's father

26
 --> 
for him getting into the industry has it was controlled by the the Woodland moved on from elevator music two barcodes he is China,

27
 --> 
symbol and we translate to a series of numbers

28
 --> 
and computer companies to identify

29
 --> 
and eliminate sitting on the beach in Miami Florida through the legendary

30
 --> 
and woodlands thinking about his days in the Boy Scout course

31
 --> 
as one tends to do on the beat drawing in the sand with his fingers

32
 --> 
when suddenly he looks down he's dragged his forefingers through the sand in the shape of concentric circles instead of&hellip;

33
 --> 
&ndash; &ndash; &ndash; He thinks in these skinny

34
 --> 
and guidelines bull's-eye very first conspiracy in the actually they didn't:

35
 --> 
convention was called the flying apparatus and I'm really glad we

36
 --> 
that was 1948 in and

37
 --> 
for about 20 years the bull's-eye idea gathered dust the scanners

38
 --> 
and other equipment needed to put the system in place were just too expensive

39
 --> 
for any of it to be feasible fast-forward to 1973 technology is

40
 --> 
now unfit more affordable

41
 --> 
and agreed the supermarket executives led by a guy named Alan happen like okay I could be doing this time there were a few other designs out there

42
 --> 
but none worked they together a list of qualities ideal barcode with 14 different companies to come up with a proposal would be no larger

43
 --> 
than what

44
 --> 
when you have square ranches had a habit of putting up depth of field liquor to read about a foot

45
 --> 
and a half above the scanner had to be omnidirectional George Laura again he was working at IBM at the time

46
 --> 
which was one of the companies competing to make the best barcode

47
 --> 
and most people thought

48
 --> 
that a circular design like Woodlands would probably work best

49
 --> 
because of the way the scanners worked most days just about every scanner was a single one

50
 --> 
when you can just picture that if you have a single wine

51
 --> 
and it was going in the direction of the bar it would not read all the bars women's original circular design solves this

52
 --> 
because it can be read from any direction

53
 --> 
and the checkout person didn't have to take your bag of Cheetos

54
 --> 
and turning just the right way before it could possibly the scanner

55
 --> 
but George didn't think the bull's-eye symbol woodwork I couldn't support that

56
 --> 
as the solution to what the grocery industry wanted

57
 --> 
because to me there was no way

58
 --> 
that it would fulfill their specifications

59
 --> 
why integrity just would not let me come up with a

60
 --> 
although winter bull said George went back to the timetable

61
 --> 
for my website I came back and I will work on it day

62
 --> 
and night come back at night forget most of us was thinking arithmetic the trying to prove

63
 --> 
that this would work also I have to admit I had a disapproved assembly others wouldn't work he ultimately came up with a rectangular park

64
 --> 
and more code space which was crucial

65
 --> 
since grocery manufacturers were already grumbling about having to make room

66
 --> 
for this new symbol on their packaging

67
 --> 
that there was still the issue of the one line scanner somehow we got the idea that

68
 --> 
if you use an ex-for the standard pattern

69
 --> 
which could be developed are usually with a pair of mirrors

70
 --> 
and by can be read by the scanner in a matter

71
 --> 
which way it was oriented so even

72
 --> 
though Woodland came up with the original idea of using lines of various with George Laura did more

73
 --> 
than just change

74
 --> 
that shape from a circle to a rectangle improved on the symbol the code behind the symbol

75
 --> 
and the scanners that read the simple

76
 --> 
even Joe Woodland thoughts of Joe

77
 --> 
when he was very enthusiastically worked with me in fact he wrote the actual proposal

78
 --> 
for the submission to the grocery industry

79
 --> 
but it was my invention of the particular symbol and barcode

80
 --> 
that we see today the symbol selection committee unanimously voted

81
 --> 
for charge learners of English symbol

82
 --> 
and code may convict the Universal product code or UPC

83
 --> 
and a year later in 1974 and released chewing them

84
 --> 
between the first item to ever be scanned the PC barcode it boggles an invented the entire layout

85
 --> 
and architectural commerce will be editing text out of a difficult to overestimate - disarmament professor of mechanical engineering at MIT Sanji Sima has also worked

86
 --> 
as an organization called GS one answer global standards one and

87
 --> 
if he needed by code on your product you have to go to GS one to get it irregular doubt

88
 --> 
that the "standardized ripening their area codes

89
 --> 
and to build about the same phone number it turns

90
 --> 
when barcodes became the standard they didn't just make checkout lines faster bailout stores to keep track of huge amounts of inventory

91
 --> 
and to collect data on

92
 --> 
what we were buying data they could use to keep us coming back

93
 --> 
for more without barcodes are simple stores might not exist

94
 --> 
but equally you know a small store might need more employees the bonnet it's like degrees

95
 --> 
that that makes the machine wrong with 12 to keep it out elements of fun of efficiency in our system drilling

96
 --> 
that you can see why

97
 --> 
for some people the barcode has come to represent everything they hate about capitalism

98
 --> 
and consumer is by gallery when I was a punk kid

99
 --> 
if of bands out barcode they were so with the market's fault

100
 --> 
that is become the symbol of the live of technology were afraid of her don't understand

101
 --> 
or being the card can wield in a larger monolithic machine the matrix

102
 --> 
if you will the live well to

103
 --> 
what industry wedding I am the founder of Azalea software here in Seattle 110 I've been writing software

104
 --> 
that prints barcodes for 25 years

105
 --> 
now the art bad they are good there just tools

106
 --> 
but most people look at them and don't even know where to start

107
 --> 
so let's demystify from minute

108
 --> 
and look at what's inside the box again

109
 --> 
what were talking about here is the UPC barcode

110
 --> 
that George Laura invented as the barcode that you and I

111
 --> 
and everyone in the world has had the most interaction with the UPC barcode is divided into two hats it's actually to barcode sitting right next to each other you can see this visually

112
 --> 
because there are these longer cars that come down in the middle

113
 --> 
and on each side is a competent guide bars and I burst

114
 --> 
how this can add that the code is starting

115
 --> 
and ending the left half of the barcode tells you

116
 --> 
who the manufacturer is in the right have tells you

117
 --> 
which particular product it is

118
 --> 
and is something I didn't realize the scanner is reading both the light

119
 --> 
and the dark lines to understand the scanner just consider yourself the dark room

120
 --> 
where the wall behind you has participated on it in your general flashlight

121
 --> 
and shined it over your head across the bars you would see the room got a little wider

122
 --> 
when your world the white bars that it would get dark

123
 --> 
when it was overlooked on black lines

124
 --> 
that don't reflect the laser light back to the scanner register

125
 --> 
as one white lines equal zero they're actually 95 evenly spaced columns on a UPC barcode of thick black line is actually a bunch of ones are next to each other the computer adds all

126
 --> 
that together

127
 --> 
and get a string of 12 numbers this number goes to the computer the computer know what's up in this table to get the information such

128
 --> 
as what is the product how much they're charging for but

129
 --> 
that is not in the barcode the only thing it's in the barcode is

130
 --> 
where the computer should look this number is also printed below the blackhead just in case the scanner isn't working

131
 --> 
which can mean really makes the whole ministry of little anti-kind take any TrackBack

132
 --> 
so

133
 --> 
when most people want to recently thought of barcodes they thought of something

134
 --> 
that was a combination of bars

135
 --> 
and stripes more recently two-dimensional barcodes

136
 --> 
which are they look like crossword puzzles have emerged the most popular being QR barcodes quick response

137
 --> 
that are scanned by cell phones we've all seen these and maybe

138
 --> 
if you must have actually bothered to pull out our cell phones

139
 --> 
and download the app required to scan the Aniston

140
 --> 
that I find China's Lane are annoying in excite no chilies I don't want more info on the blooming onion

141
 --> 
so if you did you might know that the blooming onions from outback

142
 --> 
so anyway I googled my IQ lack had slain

143
 --> 
and I got a bunch of articles basically saying

144
 --> 
that actually released on they just being misused Mosley by advertisers

145
 --> 
and to start slapping them on every single thing

146
 --> 
that Jerry lighting he still believes in them the nice thing about QR barcodes

147
 --> 
as they are not just the lookup number to an external database yes it can be a chunk of text it can be a URL it can be a whole lot of different things

148
 --> 
but there is no central authority that tells you what or

149
 --> 
how to do anything meaning you don't have to get to GS one to get a key lack of it

150
 --> 
which lets people D stuff like make a giant picture of Amy Goodman's face entirely out of DUI

151
 --> 
because this is my QR code Amy Goodman portrait made in 2304 unique QR codes

152
 --> 
that link to nine years of democracy

153
 --> 
now videos besides the QR code Lauren Woodland's original barcodes have spawned a bunch of other archives

154
 --> 
that are used for all sorts of things there's code 128 which is used

155
 --> 
for packaging

156
 --> 
and shipping is language it is by the post office to sort

157
 --> 
now their barcode phase radio frequencies defend outdated anaconda RFID tags

158
 --> 
and they are very barcodes in all pages get put in the same category

159
 --> 
because like barcodes are being used to keep track of inventory with a grocery cart full of RFID tag items one could conceivably wield their card through a big hoop

160
 --> 
that would read all the contents all it wants basically eliminating the checkout line entirely allowing more people to pass to stores

161
 --> 
even more quickly

162
 --> 
that we can all buy more stuff my current topics prescriptions library.

163
 --> 
luggage injured animals that are so many bipeds on so many things

164
 --> 
that according to Jay Whiting one future archaeologists come across remnants of our backward

165
 --> 
as civilization I stumble across a barcode big

166
 --> 
and assignment religious significance don't understand the supply chain we had no idea

167
 --> 
how far was going it we thought it would stay just within the grocery industry of course it didn't test today in the grocery industry actually went way beyond all the way to conspiracy there is in fact a silly conspiracy theory

168
 --> 
that all barcodes have the number of the beast 666 encoded yeah it has to do with those guidelines

169
 --> 
that comment the beginning middle and end of every biped

170
 --> 
and it's basically true

171
 --> 
that there are three sixes colluded in the guide buyers the answer to
