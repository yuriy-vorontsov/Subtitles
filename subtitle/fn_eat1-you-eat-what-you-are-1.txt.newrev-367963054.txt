00:00:25,250 --> 
Stephen J. DUBNER: The Union Square Greenmarket in New York City,

2
 --> 
which was founded in 1976,

3
 --> 
is a little agrarian oasis right in the heart of the city,

4
 --> 
it’s a throwback to how we used to buy our food.

5
 --> 
The writer John McPhee

6
 --> 
once spent some time in New York’s farmers markets, selling peppers

7
 --> 
and writing about how the natives handled, and manhandled,

8
 --> 
all the fresh food. Here’s what he wrote:

9
 --> 
“You people come into the market—the Greenmarket,

10
 --> 
in the open air under the downpouring sun—and you slit the tomatoes with your fingernails.

11
 --> 
With your thumbs, you excavate the cheese.

12
 --> 
You choose your stringbeans one at a time. You pulp the nectarines

13
 --> 
and rape the sweet corn. You are something wonderful,

14
 --> 
you are—people of the city—and we,

15
 --> 
who are almost without exception strangers here, are

16
 --> 
as absorbed with yoxu

17
 --> 
as you seem to be with the numbers on our hanging scales.”

18
 --> 
That’s from McPhee’s essay called “Giving Good Weight.

19
 --> 
” The title refers to the fact

20
 --> 
that you get your money’s worth at a farmer’s market—and,

21
 --> 
more important, that you can look into the eye

22
 --> 
and shake the calloused hand of the person

23
 --> 
who actually grew your food. So these days,

24
 --> 
not much has changed at Union Square. Farmers still rumble in,

25
 --> 
in the black of the morning.

26
 --> 
DUBNER: What’s your drive in the morning?

27
 --> 
DAVID: One hundred and fifty-four miles. I left at 2:30 this morning.

28
 --> 
I have a 1999 Chevrolet in back of me. I just turned four hundred

29
 --> 
and eight thousand miles on it.

30
 --> 
DUBNER: Whoa.

31
 --> 
DUBNER: David Graves owns a farm called Berkshire Berries,

32
 --> 
and today he’s selling all sorts of preserves.

33
 --> 
DAVID: Raspberry jam, strawberry, onion jam...

34
 --> 
DUBNER: Whoa!

35
 --> 
DAVID: Also, hot garlic jelly.

36
 --> 
DUBNER: And here’s Kelly. She works for Windfall Farms,

37
 --> 
in upstate New York.

38
 --> 
KELLY: We’ve got an assortment of mesclun mix,

39
 --> 
we’ve got various micro greens, a micro mix, we do sunflower greens,

40
 --> 
escarole, we do edible flowers,

41
 --> 
throughout the rest of the year we’ll start bringing in some root vegetables,

42
 --> 
uh, carrots, parsnips, turnips, radishes, potatoes, garlic,

43
 --> 
pretty much we grow what we like to eat.

44
 --> 
DUBNER: And this is Ruby:

45
 --> 
RUBY: I represent a small farm upstate called Hudson Valley Duck.

46
 --> 
DUBNER: Just walk me through some of your...

47
 --> 
RUBY: Well, we have whole duck, duck breasts, duck legs and thighs,

48
 --> 
duck prosciutto, applewood smoked duck breast, a rillette,

49
 --> 
which is kind of like a rustic style of paté, legs and thighs

50
 --> 
that are already confit, which means cooked low and slow

51
 --> 
and preserved under a layer of duck fat. What else do we have?

52
 --> 
Duck salami, duck bacon.

53
 --> 
DUBNER: There’s nothing you can't do with duck!

54
 --> 
RUBY: Almost.

55
 --> 
DUBNER: So here’s a question for you. If we assume

56
 --> 
that the Union Square Greenmarket is a wonderful place —and it’s hard not to argue

57
 --> 
that it is a wonderful place —is it necessarily the model for

58
 --> 
how we should buy our food today? In other words,

59
 --> 
do we need to go fully rustic in order to get good? And yes,

60
 --> 
we do need to get good. Because

61
 --> 
while there are many fantastic things to be said about food in modern America,

62
 --> 
there’s a lot of room for improvement. The economist Tyler Cowen,

63
 --> 
who’s not a curmudgeon, not by any stretch,

64
 --> 
says we are in the middle of a food crisis.

65
 --> 
Or at least a food paradox:

66
 --> 
Tyler COWEN: If you are a foodie today you have more options

67
 --> 
than ever before. But there’s also more bad food than ever before.

68
 --> 
There’s more obesity. There’s more junk food.

69
 --> 
And you see the food world; it’s getting a lot worse

70
 --> 
and a lot better at the same time.

71
 --> 
That’s one way to think about the crisis.

72
 --> 
[THEME]

73
 --> 
ANNOUNCER: From WNYC and APM, American Public Media:

74
 --> 
This is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast

75
 --> 
that explores the hidden side of everything. Here’s your host,

76
 --> 
Stephen Dubner.

77
 --> 
DUBNER: Today we’re talking about everybody’s favorite subject: food.

78
 --> 
We like talking about food so much, in fact,

79
 --> 
that we’ve made a two-part podcast. In this first episode,

80
 --> 
we’ll talk about what’s wrong with food in America, how it got

81
 --> 
that way, and how it can get better.

82
 --> 
In the next episode we’ll look at

83
 --> 
whether eating local is the path to salvation. For now,

84
 --> 
let’s get back to Tyler Cowen.

85
 --> 
He’s an economist at George Mason University

86
 --> 
who also happens to be a serious chowhound.

87
 --> 
His latest book is called An Economist Gets Lunch: New Rules

88
 --> 
for Everyday Foodies. While economics

89
 --> 
and food might seem like a pair of ingredients

90
 --> 
that shouldn’t be mixed, Cowen points out

91
 --> 
that the two have in fact long been aligned:

92
 --> 
COWEN: If you read the early economists like Adam Smith,

93
 --> 
or Frederic Bastiat, they were obsessed with food and food markets.

94
 --> 
A lot of early economics, it is a theory of food and the food supply,

95
 --> 
because at

96
 --> 
that time food was a very large percentage of national economies.

97
 --> 
It was an important issue. People could die or starve

98
 --> 
if the harvest didn’t go well. So economics

99
 --> 
and food have been intimately related really from the beginning.

100
 --> 
And I’m trying to put food back in the centerpiece of economics.

101
 --> 
DUBNER: Cowen has a popular economics blog,

102
 --> 
called Marginal Revolution,

103
 --> 
and a separate blog called Tyler Cowen’s Ethnic Dining Guide.

104
 --> 
He has lots of rules for finding the best restaurant meals.

105
 --> 
For instance: Cheap food is usually better than expensive food,

106
 --> 
especially when you find it in a strip mall or at a food truck.

107
 --> 
Here’s another Cowen rule: if you come across

108
 --> 
what Cowen calls an “ugly and unknown” item on the menu, order it.

109
 --> 
One more Cowen rule:

110
 --> 
while you might be drawn to a restaurant full of good-looking,

111
 --> 
happy people, avoid it. People

112
 --> 
who are serious about food generally don’t look that way.

113
 --> 
And last of all: don’t be a food snob. Food snobs, Cowen says,

114
 --> 
are messing up everything.

115
 --> 
They place too much emphasis on expensive food or trendy food, or:

116
 --> 
COWEN: There’s another kind of food snob

117
 --> 
where everything has to be like a farmer’s market,

118
 --> 
everything has to be sustainable,

119
 --> 
everything has to be in some way modest or geared down,

120
 --> 
or hippie-like.

121
 --> 
DUBNER: As Cowen sees it,

122
 --> 
too many people spend too much energy worrying about their own pet preferences,

123
 --> 
which takes focus away from the real problems.

124
 --> 
And there are real problems. For instance,

125
 --> 
about 15 percent of Americans are said to be “food insecure,

126
 --> 
” meaning they don’t have enough to eat. And 35 percent are obese.

127
 --> 
Our number one cause of death is heart disease, and it’s quite likely

128
 --> 
that a lot of things we eat contribute to that.

129
 --> 
Added to this mix is the fact that we’re only

130
 --> 
now slowly crawling out of a long, bad food rut.

131
 --> 
COWEN: I think there’s a very bad period for American food.

132
 --> 
It runs something like 1910 through maybe the 1980s.

133
 --> 
And that’s the age of the frozen TV dinner, of the sugar donut,

134
 --> 
of fast food, of the chain, and really a lot of it’s not very good.

135
 --> 
If you go back to the nineteenth century and you read Europeans

136
 --> 
who come to the United States,

137
 --> 
they’re really quite impressed by the freshness and variety of

138
 --> 
what is on offer.

139
 --> 
But we went a very particular route in our food world, and

140
 --> 
for a good seventy

141
 --> 
or eighty years we had some of the worst food in the developed world,

142
 --> 
and that’s the hole we’ve been trying to climb out of.

143
 --> 
DUBNER: The conventional reason that’s given for

144
 --> 
why our food got bad is that we were victims of our own success:

145
 --> 
COWEN: It’s the notion that we did agribusiness first,

146
 --> 
we did long-scale, long-distance transportation first,

147
 --> 
we commercialized everything first, and we got junk food, and chains,

148
 --> 
and bad supermarkets because of commercialization.

149
 --> 
That’s the standard story.

150
 --> 
DUBNER: But that’s not the whole story, Cowen says.

151
 --> 
There are specific, overlooked, moments in history

152
 --> 
that hurt the way we eat.

153
 --> 
ANNOUNCER: In 1924,

154
 --> 
a law was passed to restrict immigration from countries outside the Western hemisphere.

155
 --> 
COWEN: So the mid 1920s,

156
 --> 
the first thing we do is we choke off immigration,

157
 --> 
which is just going to kill off the quality of our food. Like,

158
 --> 
imagine current American dining without immigration.

159
 --> 
DUBNER:

160
 --> 
The culinary stagnation caused by immigration policy ran straight into the Great Depression:

161
 --> 
COWEN: That doesn’t help the restaurant trade either;

162
 --> 
it doesn’t help dining out.

163
 --> 
DUBNER: And that coincided with another downward force on good food:

164
 --> 
COWEN: Prohibition,

165
 --> 
which puts out of business a lot of the best restaurants.

166
 --> 
DUBNER: As Cowen sees it, restaurants were seedbeds of innovation,

167
 --> 
but during Prohibition,

168
 --> 
some of the best restaurants were forced to shut down

169
 --> 
since they couldn’t survive without alcohol sales. Now,

170
 --> 
interestingly, the overall number of restaurants in the U.S. tripled

171
 --> 
between 1919 and 1929, but they weren’t the kind of restaurants

172
 --> 
that a food lover would love.

173
 --> 
COWEN: What you get are more diners, more fast food shops,

174
 --> 
more just ordinary food. Food is much more for children. Children,

175
 --> 
I’m sorry to say, they don’t have great taste in food.

176
 --> 
They like soft, they like sweet, they like Wonder Bread.

177
 --> 
COWEN: So American food becomes more food for children.

178
 --> 
DUBNER: So the American food scene became a bit of a kindergarchy,

179
 --> 
with a surge in family-friendly restaurants —much more so

180
 --> 
than in other countries.

181
 --> 
DUBNER: Another turning point for American food: World War II.

182
 --> 
ANNOUNCER: On this 1,

183
 --> 
048th day of American democracy at war against the foes of freedom,

184
 --> 
we bring you our mayor, the Honorable F.H. LaGuardia,

185
 --> 
speaking to you from his desk in City Hall in another talk to the people.

186
 --> 
Ladies and gentlemen, his honor, the Mayor.

187
 --> 
MAYOR LAGUARDIA: Patience and fortitude.

188
 --> 
DUBNER: New York City. January 28, 1945.

189
 --> 
MAYOR LAGUARDIA:

190
 --> 
I want to talk to you today both about the meat situation...

191
 --> 
COWEN: People still wanted to eat meat; meat wouldn’t always be fresh.

192
 --> 
MAYOR LAGUARDIA: You take the neck, for instance. Betty,

193
 --> 
get me the bones so that I can describe it better.

194
 --> 
Now here I have one. Let me describe it to you. The piece

195
 --> 
that I have in my hands has been boned,

196
 --> 
but there is a real good supply of meat in it.

197
 --> 
If you would want to take a cleaver and break it into smaller pieces,

198
 --> 
it would make a good stew and gravy with potatoes or dumplings

199
 --> 
and the children would like it.

200
 --> 
DUBNER: Strangely enough, Tyler Cowen says, U.S.

201
 --> 
meat consumption didn’t decline during World War II.

202
 --> 
But it wasn’t the same meat as they were eating before …

203
 --> 
COWEN: People ate a lot of Spam. It’s a canned good;

204
 --> 
it doesn’t taste very good.

205
 --> 
What we did in wartime was gear up our production of everything.

206
 --> 
We had to produce a lot, including food, very quickly

207
 --> 
and have it be produced in a form that could be stored.

208
 --> 
And we made our beef and our pork and everything else just not nearly

209
 --> 
as good.

210
 --> 
DUBNER: World War II forced us to excel at industrializing our food

211
 --> 
and transporting it long distances. Once the war was over,

212
 --> 
we kept going in this direction.

213
 --> 
This industrialization trend was eventually met by another trend:

214
 --> 
a flood of women in the workforce—which, it turns out,

215
 --> 
furthered our appetite for processed, readily available food.

216
 --> 
COWEN: You want foods that are easy to handle, quick to heat

217
 --> 
or reheat, somehow very convenient

218
 --> 
and not necessarily the best foods. Women have started working,

219
 --> 
they have less time in the kitchen, but you don’t

220
 --> 
yet have all the innovations you have today. And

221
 --> 
what you see happening is as two-earner couples

222
 --> 
and television spread across the world, food ways change

223
 --> 
and in some ways decline at first, and it takes a while

224
 --> 
for markets to adjust to that.

225
 --> 
DUBNER: You write, “Quick

226
 --> 
and microwaveable meals were developed by bacteriologists rather

227
 --> 
than chefs.” Not a good thing. You write,

228
 --> 
“Television enabled advertising

229
 --> 
and homogeneous national brands to emerge.” So Tyler,

230
 --> 
when I read that and when I hear you talk now,

231
 --> 
you sound quite convincingly like the standard kind of food snob.

232
 --> 
I mean you personally are quite dismissive of bad food, correct?

233
 --> 
Am I right, or no?

234
 --> 
COWEN: Correct.

235
 --> 
DUBNER: You put a lot of effort into eating food

236
 --> 
that you really want to eat, correct?

237
 --> 
COWEN: It’s fun, not effort, but correct.

238
 --> 
DUBNER: And yet you’re also against what you call ‘food snobbery.

239
 --> 
’ You write, “That food snobbery is killing entrepreneurship

240
 --> 
and innovation.” And that, “Food snobs are right

241
 --> 
that local food tastes better, but they’re wrong that it’s better

242
 --> 
for the environment, and they’re wrong that cheap food is bad food.

243
 --> 
” So, okay,

244
 --> 
you do a great impression at first listen at least of a food snob.

245
 --> 
But then talk to me about where you and they split.

246
 --> 
COWEN: There are a lot of different issues in what you bring up,

247
 --> 
but let me just give you a few traits of food snobs

248
 --> 
that I would differ from. I think agribusiness

249
 --> 
and consumerism are seen as the great villains.

250
 --> 
I think both are essential, we can’t do without them.

251
 --> 
They feed the seven billion people in the world.

252
 --> 
We do need to improve them,

253
 --> 
but I would work on improving them through innovation.

254
 --> 
The biggest food problem in the world today is

255
 --> 
that agricultural productivity is slowing down and

256
 --> 
for a lot of the world food prices are going up. And for

257
 --> 
that we need more business, technology and innovation,

258
 --> 
not locavorism.

259
 --> 
DUBNER: Coming up... if we assume

260
 --> 
that this messy food system of ours needs fixing,

261
 --> 
what are the solutions?

262
 --> 
Alice WATERS: I think that the work of the farmer,

263
 --> 
it needs to be elevated to a very important and vital place.

264
 --> 
DUBNER: And, what does dinner look like tonight?

265
 --> 
DUBNER: I’m curious, Michael, what are you going to have

266
 --> 
for dinner tonight, do you know yet?

267
 --> 
Michael POLLAN: You know, I don’t know

268
 --> 
because I’m going to a restaurant.

269
 --> 
DUBNER: What kind of restaurant?

270
 --> 
POLLAN: I’m going to Chez Panisse.

271
 --> 
DUBNER: I’m going to a restaurant.

272
 --> 
[UNDERWRITING]

273
 --> 
ANNOUNCER: From WNYC and APM, American Public Media,

274
 --> 
this is Freakonomics Radio. Here’s your host, Stephen Dubner.

275
 --> 
DUBNER: Michael Pollan is a writer

276
 --> 
who has become a kind of national food philosopher.

277
 --> 
He says a lot of our food problems are due to what’s called “the omnivore’s dilemma,

278
 --> 
” which is also the title of one of his books.

279
 --> 
POLLAN: The phrase “the omnivore’s dilemma” is an anthropological term

280
 --> 
for a, um, an omnivore that can eat so many different things, some of

281
 --> 
which is not good for you, some of which will kill you,

282
 --> 
and deciding between what is good and what is bad is a big part of

283
 --> 
why we have these giant brains we have. And that anxiety, you know,

284
 --> 
afflicts us. It doesn’t afflict the cow or the koala. I mean,

285
 --> 
they eat that one thing, and if it’s not that one thing,

286
 --> 
it’s not lunch. And things are pretty simple

287
 --> 
and you don’t need a big brain you just need a big stomach to digest all those leaves.

288
 --> 
And

289
 --> 
so it’s part of our existential predicament to worry first do we have enough food

290
 --> 
and second do we have the right food.

291
 --> 
DUBNER: I guess the clichéd way to ask this question would be if you,

292
 --> 
Michael Pollan, were king of the day, or food czar for the day,

293
 --> 
or agriculture secretary for a year, God forbid for your sake

294
 --> 
that you’d have to do that job, it’d be miserable.

295
 --> 
POLLAN: And for the nation’s sake.

296
 --> 
DUBNER: But, okay,

297
 --> 
so you’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the problems

298
 --> 
that have come to exist and how they’ve come to exist,

299
 --> 
but start to talk about some solutions from the production side, not

300
 --> 
yet from the consumer side, but from the production side.

301
 --> 
POLLAN: Sure,

302
 --> 
well I think one of the most important things to do is to diversify our agriculture.

303
 --> 
You know, we’re growing vast amounts of corn and soybeans,

304
 --> 
these commodity crops that we heavily subsidize the planting of.

305
 --> 
And it’s too much of a good thing, or too much of a so-so thing. And

306
 --> 
that we should devise mechanisms in our agricultural policy

307
 --> 
that reward farmers for having more than one or two crops,

308
 --> 
because the more different crops they have,

309
 --> 
the less need they’ll have for fertilizers, which are, you know,

310
 --> 
huge fossil fuel burners, the less need they’d have for, you know,

311
 --> 
toxic chemicals and weed control problems,

312
 --> 
and it would allow us to diversify our diet on the consuming end.

313
 --> 
Because one of our problems with diet, too, is monoculture.

314
 --> 
We eat just too much of a very small handful of not very good

315
 --> 
for us things like sugar and high fructose corn syrup. So,

316
 --> 
so I guess I would try to figure out a way to get farmers to diversify

317
 --> 
and that’s not easy by any means

318
 --> 
because mechanization pushes you in exactly the opposite direction.

319
 --> 
DUBNER: Talk to me for a minute about the subsidy part,

320
 --> 
which I know you’ve written about a lot. You say

321
 --> 
that we’re over-reliant on things like soybean and corn

322
 --> 
and we use it in anything and everything to our dietary detriment.

323
 --> 
But…

324
 --> 
POLLAN: Well, yeah,

325
 --> 
because those crops are really the building blocks of fast food.

326
 --> 
You’ve got the high fructose corn syrup coming of the corn,

327
 --> 
and you have the hydrogenated oils coming out the soy.

328
 --> 
And right there you’ve got a fast food meal.

329
 --> 
DUBNER: But persuade me that that’s not just

330
 --> 
what the public wants to eat and that the market wants to buy

331
 --> 
and sell. In other words, talk to me about

332
 --> 
how this isn’t the way a market’s working,

333
 --> 
this is the way a government-subsidized market is working.

334
 --> 
POLLAN: Well, the reason that we subsidize those crops is not

335
 --> 
because people wanted to eat them, necessarily.

336
 --> 
Nobody actually thought to eat soy or any byproducts of soy,

337
 --> 
and hydrogenated soy oil and high fructose corn syrup were not things

338
 --> 
that anybody was clambering for.

339
 --> 
They actually grew out of an overproduction.

340
 --> 
And one of the geniuses of capitalism is

341
 --> 
when you have too much of something

342
 --> 
that nobody wants you’ll figure out how to trick it into a form

343
 --> 
where people will eat it or buy it.

344
 --> 
So overproduction breeds ingenuity, also. And

345
 --> 
why did we have overproduction? One of the reasons is

346
 --> 
that we subsidize these crops. And one of the reasons

347
 --> 
that we subsidize them is

348
 --> 
that it’s easier to subsidize storable commodities

349
 --> 
than it is things like broccoli or carrots. If you want to…I mean,

350
 --> 
the history of subsidies is very complicated

351
 --> 
because we began trying to support prices basically

352
 --> 
and keep farmers in business. That’s

353
 --> 
what we did during the Depression

354
 --> 
because the price of things like corn had fallen essentially to zero.

355
 --> 
People think, you know, we did it

356
 --> 
because we didn’t have enough food in the depression.

357
 --> 
Actually we had plenty of food in the depression we didn’t have enough money to buy it

358
 --> 
and the farmers were going out of business. And so we started,

359
 --> 
you know, with various systems to support the price of corn, and soy,

360
 --> 
and some other storable commodities. Over time,

361
 --> 
the point of these subsidies changed,

362
 --> 
during the Nixon Administration in particular,

363
 --> 
to force down the price of commodities rather than to hold it up. And

364
 --> 
that was a radical change,

365
 --> 
and it had the effect of leading to this vast overproduction. Now,

366
 --> 
I said that it’s harder to subsidize vegetables, and it is.

367
 --> 
And the reason being that

368
 --> 
if you subsidize something you tend to get these waves of overproduction.

369
 --> 
But with corn, and soy, and rice, and wheat, and cotton,

370
 --> 
it’s not a big problem because you can put it in a silo and store it

371
 --> 
for three to five years. So if you’ve got too much of it you can,

372
 --> 
you know, put it in the bank in effect. If you do

373
 --> 
that with vegetables you have this rotting compost. I mean,

374
 --> 
you just can’t have overproductions of broccoli without, you know,

375
 --> 
having a disaster, stinking disaster. So to the extent

376
 --> 
that the government wanted to play this role in the food system of either supporting farmers,

377
 --> 
or driving down the cost of food, commodity crops, grain is

378
 --> 
how you do it. And there are also, they underlie so many other things

379
 --> 
because you feed grain to animals.

380
 --> 
So you’re supporting animal agriculture too, indirectly;

381
 --> 
you’re subsidizing feedlots. And, you know, all this made sense,

382
 --> 
and it achieved some goals,

383
 --> 
but it had a lot of unintended consequences. And one was

384
 --> 
since these were the crops that you got paid for you planted

385
 --> 
as much of them as you can. And there were, you know, fewer limits on

386
 --> 
how much you could plant. Once upon a time, the government,

387
 --> 
in exchange for supporting you said, okay,

388
 --> 
you can grow this much corn and that’s it

389
 --> 
because they were very concerned about overproduction.

390
 --> 
DUBNER: What do you think would happen if, and this could not happen,

391
 --> 
but what do you think would happen

392
 --> 
if the federal government removed all crop subsidies overnight?

393
 --> 
POLLAN: It’s a really interesting question, and it is hypothetical

394
 --> 
because it would bring down the banking system, you know, overnight,

395
 --> 
so the Fed would not allow it to happen. There’s

396
 --> 
so much debt on farms every year, you know, trillions of dollars

397
 --> 
that farmers take out to plant, and those depend on

398
 --> 
that check coming from the government. That’s, you know, your proof

399
 --> 
that you’re going to be able to pay it back. So

400
 --> 
if would be a disaster for the banking system. And from everything

401
 --> 
that I’ve been able to learn it might not

402
 --> 
even work to undo the system that we have.

403
 --> 
DUBNER: Okay, so let’s…Let me ask you to take a step back

404
 --> 
and let’s think away from agriculture itself for a minute

405
 --> 
and think about, you know, eating. I’m curious, Michael,

406
 --> 
what are you going to have for dinner tonight, do you know yet?

407
 --> 
POLLAN: You know, I don’t know because I’m going to a restaurant.

408
 --> 
DUBNER: What kind of restaurant?

409
 --> 
POLLAN: I’m going to Chez Panisse.

410
 --> 
DUBNER: I’m going to a restaurant.

411
 --> 
POLLAN: Yeah, and I am…Well just to the café upstairs. So I don’t know

412
 --> 
what I’m going to have actually. I’m being taken to dinner.

413
 --> 
DUBNER: Ok, so I pulled up the menu here.

414
 --> 
POLLAN: What do they have?

415
 --> 
DUBNER: So dinner menu

416
 --> 
for tonight looks like we’ve got some six Hog Island sweet water oysters on the half shell with mignonette.

417
 --> 
I don’t know what mignonette means.

418
 --> 
POLLAN: It’s a little vinegar with some shallots in it.

419
 --> 
DUBNER: Thank you. Then a grilled Belgian endive with pancetta,

420
 --> 
rosemary, and egg. Squash hummus with shaved fennel

421
 --> 
and pickled cauliflower. Celery root

422
 --> 
and rocket salad with crème fraiche and beets.

423
 --> 
A house-made rigatoni with Llano Seco Ranch pork ragu.

424
 --> 
POLLAN: Oh, man, you’re making me hungry, Stephen.

425
 --> 
DUBNER: And then a bowl of Churchill-Brenneis Orchards page mandarins

426
 --> 
and Flying Disc Ranch dates.

427
 --> 
POLLAN: Yeah, well you see that one of the things

428
 --> 
that Chez pioneered doing was telling you where the food came from

429
 --> 
and putting the names of the farmers, which has become, you now,

430
 --> 
almost an obnoxious cliché in a lot of restaurants,

431
 --> 
but I actually think it was a very salutary development.

432
 --> 
That you know,

433
 --> 
one of the things we need to do in this country is raise the prestige of farming,

434
 --> 
and recognize the work that good farmers do,

435
 --> 
which is really important to us. We depend on them, and yet they’re

436
 --> 
for most of us totally anonymous.

437
 --> 
WATERS: I do really believe that...

438
 --> 
DUNBER: That’s Alice Waters herself,

439
 --> 
the owner of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, California,

440
 --> 
where Michael Pollan is going for dinner tonight.

441
 --> 
WATERS: I think that the work of the farmer,

442
 --> 
it needs to be elevated to a very important and vital place,

443
 --> 
and we need to consider the people who take that on as precious

444
 --> 
as the people who educate us in the schools. And when that happens,

445
 --> 
when we begin to value our farmers, you’d be surprised

446
 --> 
how many people will answer that call,

447
 --> 
who will really be encouraged to take on that profession.

448
 --> 
It’s happening already, just among young people

449
 --> 
who are concerned about the future of this planet, and know

450
 --> 
that we’re headed to a dead end if we don’t think about

451
 --> 
where our food comes from and take care of that land

452
 --> 
that produces our food.

453
 --> 
DUBNER: So here we are: back to the farm, and the farmer.

454
 --> 
You could call it the go-small-or-go-home food movement,

455
 --> 
with its emphasis on eating local at any expense. Tyler Cowen,

456
 --> 
the foodie economist we heard from earlier, he does not see this

457
 --> 
as any kind of broad solution:

458
 --> 
COWEN: I would say there is a better food philosophy.

459
 --> 
I think locavores like most people mean well. You know,

460
 --> 
we’re all imperfect. We all do things and hold views for reasons

461
 --> 
which are not totally rational.

462
 --> 
And the purpose is to have some kind of dialogue

463
 --> 
and get us to a better place.

464
 --> 
DUBNER: On the next installment of Freakonomics Radio,

465
 --> 
we’ll continue this conversation. And we’ll keep looking

466
 --> 
for a better place. We’ll talk about locavorism,

467
 --> 
and run some numbers. Some of them will surprise you:

468
 --> 
David CLEVELAND: This is what really shocked us is we found that

469
 --> 
when you added up all these different ways in

470
 --> 
which locally grown produce got to people in Santa Barbara County we found

471
 --> 
that less than five percent of the fruits

472
 --> 
and vegetables consumed in Santa Barbara County were actually grown in Santa Barbara County.

473
 --> 
And the other ninety-five percent were imported.

474
 --> 
Ed GLAESER: And we certainly are right to worry a lot about whether

475
 --> 
or not our food is fresh, and good, and tasty.

476
 --> 
But I just keep coming back to feeling a certain amount of satisfaction

477
 --> 
that I’m eating grapes

478
 --> 
that are keeping up the standard of living in Chile.

479
 --> 
DUBNER: As for me, for dinner tonight … sure,

480
 --> 
I’d love to sit down with Michael Pollan at Chez Panisse

481
 --> 
for some house-made rigatoni with Llano Seco Ranch pork ragu.

482
 --> 
But that’s in California. I’m in New York. Still,

483
 --> 
I think I will go local tonight. Now, technology,

484
 --> 
has of course changed what “local” means.

485
 --> 
I can use my iPhone to load menupages.com and see what’s available

486
 --> 
for delivery in my neighborhood. Let’s see: 36 Chinese restaurants

487
 --> 
and 42 Japanese, twenty-nine kosher,

488
 --> 
three restaurants with wild game (not kosher), 19 Mediterranean,

489
 --> 
8 Caribbean, 26 French and 79 Italian… 36 called “American”

490
 --> 
(traditional), and 22 called “American” (new).
