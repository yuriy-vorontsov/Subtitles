Stephen J. DUBNER: This is the Camino Real farmer’s market in Goleta,

2
 --> 
California. It’s in Santa Barbara County,

3
 --> 
about 100 miles northwest of Los Angeles. The produce is bountiful,

4
 --> 
and it’s local…

5
 --> 
[SANTA BARBARA FARMER’S MARKET]

6
 --> 
[SHOPPER] You use that on ribs?

7
 --> 
[SHOPPER] Yeah! It’s so good.

8
 --> 
[JEFF] We’ve got lettuce, and greens and chard, leeks and fennel,

9
 --> 
and turnips, and artichokes, and spinach, and cabbage, broccoli

10
 --> 
and about everything else you can get your hands on this time of year.

11
 --> 
Our farm is about two miles away from where we are selling right

12
 --> 
now at the farmer’s market.

13
 --> 
[SHOPPER] It’s just amazing.

14
 --> 
DUBNER: Santa Barbara County has a lot going for it: the beach,

15
 --> 
the University of California, Santa Barbara,

16
 --> 
and farming—it is in the top 1% of agriculture-producing counties in the U.

17
 --> 
S., about $1.2 billion worth a year. Now, imagine for a moment

18
 --> 
that everything is interrupted by some kind of a natural disaster:

19
 --> 
David CLEVELAND: In 2005 there was a mudslide at La Conchita,

20
 --> 
which is a community in the southeastern part of Santa Barbara County,

21
 --> 
right on the coast.

22
 --> 
DUBNER: That’s David Cleveland.

23
 --> 
He teaches environmental studies at UC Santa Barbara.

24
 --> 
The mudslide he’s talking about killed ten people.

25
 --> 
CLEVELAND: And also blocked off the 101 freeway and the railroad,

26
 --> 
which are the main transportation connections with Los Angeles.

27
 --> 
And these transportation links were closed for at least a week.

28
 --> 
DUBNER:

29
 --> 
So Santa Barbara couldn’t ship its produce down to the distribution centers in L.

30
 --> 
A., or anywhere else, nor could it ship produce in. But

31
 --> 
that wouldn’t seem to be a problem, since Santa Barbara grows

32
 --> 
so much.

33
 --> 
You’d think the grocery stores would still have plenty of fruits

34
 --> 
and veg.

35
 --> 
CLEVELAND: So we had produce sections that were empty.

36
 --> 
And here’s farmers with boxes of harvested fruit and vegetables

37
 --> 
that they can’t, their distributors can’t pick them up. And

38
 --> 
so farmers said oh yeah we went

39
 --> 
and talked to the produce manager at this grocery chain

40
 --> 
and we said look we got stuff that we can’t get out

41
 --> 
and you can’t get anything in, let’s make a deal.

42
 --> 
And they were told no, sorry, we got a contract.

43
 --> 
DUBNER: Did you feel it was absurd

44
 --> 
or along the lines of borderline criminal?

45
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Often those two things go together, I think.

46
 --> 
[THEME]

47
 --> 
ANNOUNCER: From WNYC and APM, American Public Media:

48
 --> 
This is Freakonomics Radio, the podcast

49
 --> 
that explores the hidden side of everything. Here’s your host,

50
 --> 
Stephen Dubner.

51
 --> 
DUBNER: Today, the second episode of our two-part podcast,

52
 --> 
“You Eat What You Are.” Last time out,

53
 --> 
we heard from the food-obsessed economist Tyler Cowen.

54
 --> 
Tyler COWEN: There’s another kind of food snob

55
 --> 
where everything has to be like a farmer’s market,

56
 --> 
everything has to be sustainable,

57
 --> 
everything has to be in some way modest or geared down,

58
 --> 
or hippie-like.

59
 --> 
DUBNER: And from food-philosophers Michael Pollan and Alice Waters:

60
 --> 
Michael POLLAN: You know,

61
 --> 
one of the things we need to do in this country is raise the prestige of farming,

62
 --> 
and recognize the work that good farmers do,

63
 --> 
which is really important to us. We depend on them, and yet they’re

64
 --> 
for most of us totally anonymous.

65
 --> 
Alice WATERS: I do really believe that...I think

66
 --> 
that the work of the farmer,

67
 --> 
it needs to be elevated to a very important and vital place.

68
 --> 
DUBNER: And so, today, we try to find out:

69
 --> 
is going local the way to go? That’s

70
 --> 
why we’re starting in Santa Barbara County, which, it turns out,

71
 --> 
is a pretty good microcosm for just how complicated—or just

72
 --> 
how messed-up—our food network is. Here you’ve got a place

73
 --> 
that grows more than a billion dollars worth of food a year but,

74
 --> 
as you just heard, when transportation is cut off for a week,

75
 --> 
the produce sections at grocery stores start to empty out. Isn’t

76
 --> 
that bizarre? You’d think, with all that local produce,

77
 --> 
that Santa Barbara would be the epicenter of the local-food movement.

78
 --> 
So what’s going on here? David Cleveland, the U.C.

79
 --> 
Santa Barbara professor, he decided to find out.

80
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Time Magazine, I think it was four or five years ago,

81
 --> 
the cover of Time Magazine was “Local the New Organic,” and you know,

82
 --> 
that kind of…One of my students brought that in

83
 --> 
and said hey have you seen this, and I said no I haven’t seen that.

84
 --> 
Because I had been teaching a class on rural agriculture for last ten

85
 --> 
or fifteen years at UCSB,

86
 --> 
and localization hasn’t been an explicit part of

87
 --> 
what we talked about. And you know, I just realized

88
 --> 
that this was being promoted as a remedy for a lot of the problems

89
 --> 
that people, many people saw with the mainstream food system.

90
 --> 
DUBNER: And when you see this being promoted as a remedy, or maybe

91
 --> 
even a panacea it sounds like you’re saying, yeah?

92
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Uh huh.

93
 --> 
DUBNER: And what was your first reaction to that then?

94
 --> 
Was it like yeah this is what we need, or, uh oh,

95
 --> 
this might not be the right prescription? Or, I don’t know,

96
 --> 
maybe a combination?

97
 --> 
CLEVELAND: It was a combination because, you know,

98
 --> 
I have an emotional…It’s emotionally appealing the idea of yeah local food,

99
 --> 
going to the farmers’ market, and you know, all the stuff

100
 --> 
that goes with that.

101
 --> 
And at the same time my academic background was saying well

102
 --> 
how do we really know if this is working?

103
 --> 
And we’re all familiar with the concept of greenwash

104
 --> 
and self-delusion, and you know, misplaced assumptions, and

105
 --> 
so I immediately said, well gosh, I wonder we should really see

106
 --> 
how local the Santa Barbara County food system already is,

107
 --> 
because we have thriving farmer’s markets,

108
 --> 
CSA’s are growing like gangbusters,

109
 --> 
and restaurants are advertising their local food,

110
 --> 
and the UCSB dining residential dining is a major program to get more local food.

111
 --> 
And so I said will gosh let’s just see how local we are.

112
 --> 
DUBNER: So how did you come to this? Did you come…Were you interested?

113
 --> 
Did you grow up on a farm? Did you grow up thinking

114
 --> 
and knowing a lot about agriculture,

115
 --> 
or did you come from the environmental side?

116
 --> 
Were you an environmentalist

117
 --> 
who wanted to get into the science of it?

118
 --> 
CLEVELAND: I came from the food side. I think I…

119
 --> 
DUBNER: Meaning you eat? Meaning? What does that mean the food side?

120
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Meaning I’ve always been interested in food.

121
 --> 
It’s always been…My early years were on a farm.

122
 --> 
And I’ve always been interested in eating good food. You know,

123
 --> 
like a person always reads the labels when they buy stuff. So

124
 --> 
that kind of interest. And I guess

125
 --> 
that coincided with an interest in the bigger picture of the environment

126
 --> 
and population, and how do we deal with this stuff?

127
 --> 
When I did my dissertation research in Ghana, West Africa,

128
 --> 
in the northeast part of the county,

129
 --> 
it was during one of the major drought periods.

130
 --> 
And both years I was there was a major famine.

131
 --> 
And I would lie in my little mud hut at night thinking

132
 --> 
why are people in this part of the world struggling, working hard,

133
 --> 
they’re smart people who work hard all day long and

134
 --> 
yet they’re going hungry.

135
 --> 
And then there are other people in other parts of the world

136
 --> 
who don’t know nearly as much about how to grow food and don’t work

137
 --> 
as hard and they have too much food. And just you know,

138
 --> 
just thinking about those issues kind of drove my interest in understanding agri-food systems.

139
 --> 
DUBNER: So, David, I’m curious can you just describe kind of,

140
 --> 
you know, your drive from home to the university? What do you pass?

141
 --> 
Are you passing strawberry fields and almond groves?

142
 --> 
What’s it look like?

143
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Well actually I ride my bike to campus.

144
 --> 
It’s only about five and half miles,

145
 --> 
and I live on the coastal bike path so it’s very nice.

146
 --> 
But I pass organic farms on the way. Actually yesterday

147
 --> 
when I biked into campus there were strawberries ripening on their plastic mulch,

148
 --> 
and fava beans growing. And I could smell the compost and manure.

149
 --> 
DUBNER: So you’re describing

150
 --> 
what to me at least over the wire sounds like a locavore nirvana.

151
 --> 
You’re talking about these restaurants and

152
 --> 
even the university dining hall, you know, advertises its local food.

153
 --> 
And you bike to work through the lovely alternatingly sweet

154
 --> 
and pungent smells of strawberries and manure. And so you must be,

155
 --> 
you know, from what you’re telling me

156
 --> 
so far I would think you’re living at like,

157
 --> 
you know ground zero locavore central. Was that your assumption

158
 --> 
as well?

159
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Yeah, yeah, it was like wow, this is so, let’s just see

160
 --> 
what we’re really doing because certainly the potential’s there,

161
 --> 
because I knew before we started the research

162
 --> 
that Santa Barbara was producing somewhere around 2.

163
 --> 
3 billion pounds of fruits and vegetables a year.

164
 --> 
DUBNER: So David Cleveland, along with about 10 students, worked

165
 --> 
for a year to track that 2.

166
 --> 
3 billion pounds of produce – specifically, to see

167
 --> 
how much of it was being exported and

168
 --> 
how much was being consumed locally:

169
 --> 
CLEVELAND: This is what really shocked us, is we found that

170
 --> 
when you added up all these different ways in

171
 --> 
which locally grown produce got to people in Santa Barbara County we found

172
 --> 
that less than five percent of the fruits

173
 --> 
and vegetables consumed in Santa Barbara County were actually grown in Santa Barbara County,

174
 --> 
and the other ninety-five percent were imported.

175
 --> 
DUBNER: It’s hard to even understand how that could come to pass.

176
 --> 
I mean, even

177
 --> 
if one believes in the ultimate efficiency of the most efficient markets— you’re growing the stuff right there,

178
 --> 
and then people are eating it right there, but the stuff

179
 --> 
that they’re eating is not the stuff that they’re growing. I don’t

180
 --> 
even get it.

181
 --> 
CLEVELAND: I don’t either. Yeah, this is something…I mean,

182
 --> 
part of it is the way the market is structured.

183
 --> 
DUBNER: Now, you’re not an economist,

184
 --> 
you’re an environmental scientist correct?

185
 --> 
CLEVELAND: No. I’m an anthropologist.

186
 --> 
DUBNER: Okay so because you’re not an economist I’m guessing,

187
 --> 
and forgive me I really am just guessing,

188
 --> 
I’m guessing you’re thinking well

189
 --> 
if this is the way the economy works in this case then it’s dumb.

190
 --> 
It doesn’t make sense, right, to take food that we grow locally here,

191
 --> 
ship it off to a warehouse and then ship it back to here.

192
 --> 
So you know what, in some twisted configurations of incentives

193
 --> 
that has come to pass, but it’s stupid. Was that your thought?

194
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Yeah, and my thought was that somehow this economic system,

195
 --> 
people are being rewarded economically

196
 --> 
for this kind of behavior one assumes, but somehow the reward system

197
 --> 
for economic behavior is totally out of sync with the reward system

198
 --> 
for good nutrition, for community, for environment.

199
 --> 
There’s this disconnect between economics and the reason

200
 --> 
that we grow food.

201
 --> 
DUBNER: What Cleveland is saying certainly seems to make sense: that

202
 --> 
when it comes to food,

203
 --> 
the modern economy conspires against three very important factors:

204
 --> 
good nutrition, the environment,

205
 --> 
and community – meaning local farmers and the people

206
 --> 
who support them.

207
 --> 
But Cleveland’s research was showing something different.

208
 --> 
We’ll start with the local farmers. It looked as

209
 --> 
if things were working out okay for them –

210
 --> 
why else would they sell most of their produce for export, rather

211
 --> 
than keep it local? And what about the nutrition?

212
 --> 
Here’s another surprising fact that Cleveland found:

213
 --> 
a 100% local diet wouldn’t improve nutrition within the county.

214
 --> 
Higher income might;

215
 --> 
but a dearth of local produce wasn’t the problem. Still,

216
 --> 
what about the environment? As David Cleveland puts it:

217
 --> 
“Most of what’s grown in Santa Barbara is shipped out.

218
 --> 
And most of what’s eaten in Santa Barbara is shipped in.

219
 --> 
This seems crazy,” he says. Surely that is crazy, isn’t it?

220
 --> 
Coming up: the math behind carbon emissions and local food.

221
 --> 
DUBNER: When your eyes saw that number what did you think?

222
 --> 
CLEVELAND: We went back and redid our calculations.

223
 --> 
DUBNER: And ... is there a moral upside to not eating local food?

224
 --> 
Ed GLAESER:

225
 --> 
I just keep coming back to feeling a certain amount of satisfaction

226
 --> 
that I’m eating grapes

227
 --> 
that are keeping up the standard of living in Chile.

228
 --> 
[UNDERWRITING]

229
 --> 
ANNOUNCER: From WNYC and APM, American Public Media,

230
 --> 
this is Freakonomics Radio. Here’s your host, Stephen Dubner.

231
 --> 
DUBNER: Okay, so David Cleveland,

232
 --> 
who teaches environmental studies at the University of California,

233
 --> 
Santa Barbara, found

234
 --> 
that 95 percent of the produce consumed in Santa Barbara County,

235
 --> 
which grows $1.2 billion worth of produce a year, is imported,

236
 --> 
some of it from the other side of the world,

237
 --> 
whereas 99 percent of the produce grown there is exported. Now

238
 --> 
that sounds, on the surface, like an environmental travesty.

239
 --> 
So he began looking into those numbers too. What would happen,

240
 --> 
for instance, if Santa Barbara County went totally locavore,

241
 --> 
if all the produce eaten in Santa Barbara were also grown there?

242
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Yeah, we wanted to look at, at

243
 --> 
what effect one hundred percent localization of the Santa Barbara County system,

244
 --> 
which is a physically,

245
 --> 
biologically very feasible thing to do because, you know,

246
 --> 
we have the land, we’re growing so much, and so forth. So what

247
 --> 
if we did one hundred percent localize the system, what effect would

248
 --> 
that have on greenhouse gas emissions? And we found

249
 --> 
that it wouldn’t make a lot of difference.

250
 --> 
Our savings in greenhouse gas emissions per household

251
 --> 
as a proportion of the total food system greenhouse gas emissions was less

252
 --> 
than one percent.

253
 --> 
DUBNER: Wow. When your eyes saw that number what did you think?

254
 --> 
CLEVELAND: We went back and redid our calculations.

255
 --> 
DUBNER: I don’t blame you. You thought how can this possibly be true?

256
 --> 
CLEVELAND: Right, and so, you know,

257
 --> 
it wasn’t…We didn’t think it was going to be a huge number,

258
 --> 
but we were still a bit surprised that it was less than one percent.

259
 --> 
And when you look at that in terms of what the EPA estimated

260
 --> 
for example in 2008

261
 --> 
for greenhouse gas emissions per person in the United States in 2008,

262
 --> 
it’s point one percent. So, I guess the point

263
 --> 
that we began to dawn on me and on the others was that even

264
 --> 
though our food system accounts

265
 --> 
for a huge amount of our impact on the environment,

266
 --> 
including greenhouse gas emissions,

267
 --> 
and localization is being promoted

268
 --> 
as a major cure to all that’s wrong with our current food system,

269
 --> 
in terms of one of the focal impacts it doesn’t necessarily have a great deal of effect.

270
 --> 
DUBNER: How can this be? As Cleveland says,

271
 --> 
producing food requires a lot of energy. So wouldn’t it make sense

272
 --> 
that we could use a lot less energy by transporting food shorter distances?

273
 --> 
Christopher WEBER: Well, I mean, the take home message

274
 --> 
that we learned is

275
 --> 
that basically transportation is really only about seven percent of the greenhouse gas footprint associated with the overall average American diet.

276
 --> 
DUBNER: That’s Christopher Weber, he’s a researcher at the Science

277
 --> 
and Technology Policy Institute in Washington. Back in 2008, he

278
 --> 
and a colleague, H. Scott Matthews, analyzed the U.S. food network

279
 --> 
and found

280
 --> 
that the energy used in the transportation of food represents a relatively trivial amount of the overall energy used.

281
 --> 
Their paper made a bit of noise.

282
 --> 
DUBNER: So this paper that you wrote, I understand

283
 --> 
that you’ve said no matter what you do…You’re a young guy,

284
 --> 
right you’re in your early…

285
 --> 
WEBER: Relatively, sure.

286
 --> 
DUBNER: Early thirties maybe, mid thirties?

287
 --> 
WEBER: Yeah. Yeah.

288
 --> 
DUBNER: Okay, and so you’ve got a long career ahead of you,

289
 --> 
and I’ve heard you say no matter what you do,

290
 --> 
unless maybe barring a Nobel or Pulitzer Prize

291
 --> 
that what’s going to be on your gravestone is this paper

292
 --> 
that you wrote as your graduate thesis, yes?

293
 --> 
WEBER: Yeah, it certainly seems that way.

294
 --> 
DUBNER: One person

295
 --> 
who found the Weber-Matthews research interesting was Ed Glaeser.

296
 --> 
He’s an economist at Harvard

297
 --> 
who spends a lot of time thinking about where and how people live:

298
 --> 
urban density vs. suburban sprawl, things like that.

299
 --> 
GLAESER: There’s a 2008 article by Weber and Matthews

300
 --> 
who actually go through the various environmental costs involved in food production,

301
 --> 
particularly carbon dioxide emissions. And they found

302
 --> 
that there’s about 8.

303
 --> 
9 tons of carbon dioxide per household per year from food consumption in the United States.

304
 --> 
Out of that 8.9 tons only 0.4 tons, so about five percent, less

305
 --> 
than five percent came from food delivery to you.

306
 --> 
And all agricultural transportation up and down the food chain

307
 --> 
that delivers only about one ton of carbon dioxide per household annually.

308
 --> 
So there’s a lot of carbon emissions involved in food,

309
 --> 
but you want to think about it

310
 --> 
as being in the very heart of food production which is going to go on

311
 --> 
wherever you eat it or not. And there you’re going to, you know,

312
 --> 
you will make choices about what you’re eating.

313
 --> 
And obviously animals tend to be more energy intensive than grains

314
 --> 
for example. Those choices are going to matter a lot more as to

315
 --> 
whether the food is shipped long distances

316
 --> 
because it just doesn’t require

317
 --> 
that much energy to ship food fairly long distances in this world.

318
 --> 
DUBNER: So in keeping with that argument, the idea is

319
 --> 
that a bigger farm, whether it’s a sheep farm

320
 --> 
or a produce farm is going to be more efficient in its production per pound of food,

321
 --> 
let’s say, than a smaller local farm, in

322
 --> 
that the transportation is just not a big enough piece of the equation to really tip the scale?

323
 --> 
GLAESER: That’s the usual argument. I find it fairly compelling.

324
 --> 
The second argument that’s made,

325
 --> 
and this has been particularly done comparing food production in England with other areas,

326
 --> 
so English researchers

327
 --> 
for some reason have been particularly aggressive on this.

328
 --> 
But food production in the U.K.,

329
 --> 
and I think it must be the same thing in New England

330
 --> 
for our climate isn’t that different, finds

331
 --> 
that the greenhouse gas emissions involved in eating English tomatoes are about three times

332
 --> 
as high as eating Spanish tomatoes

333
 --> 
because you require hothouses to grow these things, and, you know,

334
 --> 
you just have a better climate for food production. So,

335
 --> 
at the heart of economics, right,

336
 --> 
is this notion of comparative advantage. And

337
 --> 
if you think about David Ricardo two hundred years ago talking about

338
 --> 
what a great thing it is that the English could export textiles

339
 --> 
and import wine from Portugal,

340
 --> 
when you’re giving up on the global system of trade,

341
 --> 
you’re giving up all of that.

342
 --> 
And that’s not just about economic productivity,

343
 --> 
it’s also about energy intensivity, because the places

344
 --> 
that are naturally productive at growing food are also places

345
 --> 
where you can do it with less artificial energy,

346
 --> 
with less artificial water and so forth.

347
 --> 
DUBNER: Now, let’s say I believe you,

348
 --> 
and I have no reason not to believe you. In fact, I do believe you.

349
 --> 
But, it seems as though there’s a certain,

350
 --> 
maybe it’s a pretty small quadrant of our population,

351
 --> 
but they’re pretty noisy,

352
 --> 
who just seem to make a very compelling argument

353
 --> 
that it’s just a bad idea to live in a world

354
 --> 
where we’re shipping food from across the planet to eat here,

355
 --> 
that we should be better than that. Maybe…You know, so I guess

356
 --> 
what I’m saying is I hear your economist argument,

357
 --> 
but then I think from my personal moral perspective,

358
 --> 
I don’t want to do that. I don’t like the idea.

359
 --> 
I don’t like the idea of a big sheep farm in New Zealand,

360
 --> 
or a big grape produce farm in Chile bundling up all these tons,

361
 --> 
and tons, and tons of stuff, putting it on a big ship,

362
 --> 
getting it all the way over to me,

363
 --> 
and then it trucks to my supermarket or my market and I buy it there.

364
 --> 
I just don’t…I hate that idea. Why is there more hatred for food

365
 --> 
and the complexity of the production and transportation of food

366
 --> 
than there is for let’s say a t-shirt or an iPad?

367
 --> 
GLAESER: Well, food is so personal, right? I mean,

368
 --> 
it is our most basic of needs, right?

369
 --> 
And the idea of something wrong being with our food cuts to the very heart of our stomachs,

370
 --> 
of our souls almost. So it’s not so surprising

371
 --> 
that people have these deep emotional reactions to food.

372
 --> 
And we certainly are right to worry a lot about whether

373
 --> 
or not our food is fresh, and good, and tasty.

374
 --> 
But I just keep coming back to feeling a certain amount of satisfaction

375
 --> 
that I’m eating grapes

376
 --> 
that are keeping up the standard of living in Chile.

377
 --> 
DUBNER: Let me ask you this, Ed,

378
 --> 
you wrote a little bit about Michelle Obama’s garden at the White House

379
 --> 
and her pretty constant efforts to talk about the value of nutrition generally,

380
 --> 
but also local agriculture. And you wrote this,

381
 --> 
“If the First Lady wants to help the environment she should campaign

382
 --> 
for high-rise apartments rather than plant vegetables.” Ouch,

383
 --> 
first of all, but explain.

384
 --> 
GLAESER: Well I certainly meant no disrespect for the First Lady.

385
 --> 
DUBNER: I’m sure.

386
 --> 
GLAESER:

387
 --> 
But local gardens are unlikely to be any particularly great environmental benefit.

388
 --> 
And one way to think about this is it really is much more energy efficient to move food

389
 --> 
rather than moving people. Any time we put space between us

390
 --> 
as human beings we are increasing our own difficulties in transportation,

391
 --> 
any time we build at lower densities,

392
 --> 
meaning we are driving longer distances.

393
 --> 
And that’s a tremendous potential environmental cost,

394
 --> 
whereas moving the food around is just a very small cost relative to that.

395
 --> 
So, I think really if we want to be focused on how we live and

396
 --> 
how it impacts our environmental footprints we really do want to be thinking about

397
 --> 
how is it that we bring ourselves together, how is it

398
 --> 
that we eliminate space between us, not how is it

399
 --> 
that we insert extra space that are buffers between humanity.

400
 --> 
DUBNER: So,

401
 --> 
would your view of Michelle Obama’s position on local agriculture be that,

402
 --> 
well it’s mostly benign. She’s preaching

403
 --> 
that people should have more kind of local gardens and they may

404
 --> 
or they may not, and it really doesn’t make

405
 --> 
that much of a difference? Or is your view of her stance

406
 --> 
that it’s actually not a good stance

407
 --> 
because it may be counterproductive as it kind of steals mindshare

408
 --> 
for what would be smarter ideas for how to be more efficient

409
 --> 
and effective for more people?

410
 --> 
GLAESER: I think it’s basically benign.

411
 --> 
The truth of the matter is I think she’s really just pushing

412
 --> 
for greater awareness of food and greater attention to nutrition.

413
 --> 
And that’s basically benign. What I do wish, is I do wish both her

414
 --> 
and the president would actually start talking about the virtues of urban America.

415
 --> 
I mean in some sense President Obama is the most urban president we’ve had

416
 --> 
since Teddy Roosevelt. And yet we’ve heard very little about,

417
 --> 
you know, how critical America’s cities are to our future. I mean,

418
 --> 
the fact

419
 --> 
that the three largest metropolitan areas in this country produce eighteen percent of our GDP

420
 --> 
while including only thirteen percent of our population.

421
 --> 
And they’re also important environmentally,

422
 --> 
so it’s also a frustration that…It’s fine for her to grow gardens

423
 --> 
but I would love it if we just heard a strong message about

424
 --> 
what a great thing living in dense areas,

425
 --> 
living in high-rise apartments can also be for the environment.

426
 --> 
And indeed,

427
 --> 
we’re far more likely to get significant environmental benefits from those

428
 --> 
than we are from eating locally or from urban gardens.

429
 --> 
DUBNER: At the Union Square Greenmarket,

430
 --> 
in the heart of New York City,

431
 --> 
the idea of buying local is pretty much gospel. I asked a few people,

432
 --> 
shoppers and vendors, to wrap their heads around the notion

433
 --> 
that going local isn’t saving the world.

434
 --> 
KELLY: I would find that really hard to believe...

435
 --> 
EDLAND: I may not one hundred percent be able to argue against that,

436
 --> 
but what I will argue for is why not buy it if it is grown nearby?

437
 --> 
RUBY: For me, smaller is better, for me, local is better.

438
 --> 
DUBNER: The responses were interesting and diverse: some denial,

439
 --> 
some rationalization, some switching over to the other ways in

440
 --> 
which local food is superior, like, it tastes better.

441
 --> 
When you make decisions about something as important

442
 --> 
as the environment —and as personal, as emotionally charged

443
 --> 
as food—it’s hard to hear

444
 --> 
that the factual foundation of your decision is a bit wobbly.

445
 --> 
It can be easier just to stick to your beliefs,

446
 --> 
your intuitive beliefs,

447
 --> 
than it is to deal with the weird complexities of the modern world.

448
 --> 
But here’s one piece of good news.

449
 --> 
That research paper by Christopher Weber about food miles,

450
 --> 
it didn’t stop there.

451
 --> 
WEBER: There are a few types of food

452
 --> 
that are very greenhouse-gas-intensive, per calorie, per kilogram,

453
 --> 
per however you want to measure them, and red meat

454
 --> 
and dairy are the especially bad players here. And

455
 --> 
if you are the average consumer,

456
 --> 
and again we were always looking at the average consumer,

457
 --> 
one of the big, you know, take home messages

458
 --> 
that we tried to get out to people is that you can do more

459
 --> 
for your carbon footprint by just cutting those two things out of your diet

460
 --> 
for one day a week

461
 --> 
than you can by buying every single thing locally all the time.

462
 --> 
DUBNER: So there you go.

463
 --> 
If you really want to help the environment lay off cow products.

464
 --> 
The cow is particularly greenhouse-gas-intensive in part because,

465
 --> 
like all ruminants, it naturally emits methane—its manure,

466
 --> 
its exhalation, its farts. And methane is more

467
 --> 
than 20 times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.

468
 --> 
What’s that, you say? You can’t imagine cutting back on burgers?

469
 --> 
Well, perhaps you’d consider a substitute. The kangaroo,

470
 --> 
for instance, doesn’t emit methane. Its meat? A little rubbery

471
 --> 
but tasty. So if you really want to help,

472
 --> 
what you’ve got to do is learn to love the ‘roo.
