1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,750
[Roman Mars] This is 99% Invisible. I’m Roman Mars.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,750
Since the early 1500s, when Sir Thomas Moore coined the term Utopia,

3
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,750
and probably well before then,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
people have been thinking about how to design their ideal society.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,250
Maybe it’s one that doesn’t use money.

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,000
Or one that drops the traditional family structure in favor of raising children collectively.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,750
[Delaney Hall] One, two, check.

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,500
[Roman Mars] That’s producer Delaney Hall, getting ready to visit a sort of Utopia.

9
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,000
And before she left, she packed her bag,

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:36,750
tested her recording equipment,

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,250
grabbed a few extra packs of double A batteries and...

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:45,750
[Delaney Hall] I’m just gonna fill up, fill up this tub of water.

13
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,750
[Roman Mars] ... and then thoroughly washed every item of clothing

14
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
that she was bringing with her.

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,750
[Delaney Hall] ...have a box of baking soda.

16
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:02,500
Just dumping some of it in this tub of water. To be more specific, I soaked my clothes in a tub of baking soda for 48 hours

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,250
and showered with Doctor Bronner's unscented soap for two weeks before I left.

18
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Got an old pair of jeans. I’m putting them in too.

19
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,750
[Roman Mars] Delaney reports for the show, 'State of the Reunion'.

20
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:17,750
Every episode is about a different place so she travels a lot.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,500
But she doesn’t usually go to these kinds of extremes to get ready.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,750
[Delaney Hall] But this is an unusual reporting trip I’m about to go on.

23
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,250
I’m headed to an isolated community in Eastern Arizona,

24
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,250
on the outskirts of a small town called Snowflake.

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,250
And the people who live there have given me very special instructions for how to get ready.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,250
[Roman Mars] Because for some people in Snowflake,

27
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,250
Utopia just means not being physically sick.

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:48,250
A community of people who live just outside this small rural town have a medical condition called MCS,

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,250
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.

30
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,500
It means they are seriously intolerant to laundry detergent, perfume,

31
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,500
cigarette smoke, car exhaust, commercial cleaning products.

32
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,000
[Delaney Hall] And Snowflake is a community designed around keeping that sort of stuff out.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,250
People who have MCS can be seriously affected, sometimes disabled,

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,250
by migraines, muscle pains, rashes, nausea, and fatigue.

35
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,000
[Roman Mars] But most scientific studies have not shown a strong connection between chemical exposures and symptoms.

36
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,500
There’s no real medical consensus about what causes the illness.

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:22,750
And doctors disagree about whether symptoms are physiological,

38
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,750
psychological, or both.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,500
[Delaney Hall] That means that people with MCS are often dismissed as, well,

40
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,750
hypochondriacs.

41
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,750
Many find themselves without sympathetic medical care,

42
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:37,750
or access to services that people with recognized disabilities might have.

43
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,000
There are a subset of doctors who believe in MCS and treat it,

44
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:45,000
but most mainstream physicians avoid the diagnosis.

45
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,250
And so a lot of people with the illness fall back on trial and error,

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,500
designing their diets, habits,

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,500
and environments to try and make themselves feel better.

48
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
It’s my first morning in Snowflake,

49
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,000
and this is really an incredible landscape. Very flat, very dry.

50
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:12,250
You can see a long way in every direction and the sky is very blue.

51
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,500
The houses out here are all built in a really simple style.

52
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,000
They look like they have sheet metal walls, pitched roofs,

53
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,750
they’re generally pretty small.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,750
[Roman Mars] Delaney didn’t go to Snowflake to find out whether or not MCS was ‘real'.

55
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,500
She went to learn how people have built new lives and homes,

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,250
designed to fit their very particular needs out there on the remote,

57
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:40,750
grassy plateau.

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,500
[Susan Malloy] Hi, I hope you’re Delaney.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,500
[Delaney Hall] I am, yeah.

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,000
[Susan Malloy] Hi.

61
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,500
[Delaney Hall] Susan Malloy has short curly hair and a wide grin.

62
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,500
It’s below freezing but all the windows in her small house are open.

63
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,500
For people with MCS,

64
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:02,750
their home is the only environment they can really control.

65
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,500
I’m suddenly very aware of my smell; I’m worried I didn’t prepare well enough.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,500
Susan offers me a cup of coffee.

67
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:12,500
[Susan Malloy] Do you like milk in it?

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,500
[Delaney Hall] Sure.

69
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,250
[Susan Malloy] Okay.

70
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:15,750
[Delaney Hall] And then, just like I worried...

71
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,000
[Susan Malloy] I smell cigarettes.

72
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,000
[Delaney Hall] Um, what would you like me to do?

73
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,250
[Susan Malloy] I’m not quite sure.

74
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,000
[Delaney Hall] Okay.

75
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,250
[Susan Malloy] I’m gonna get close to you for just a sec, okay?

76
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,250
[Delaney Hall] Sure.

77
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,500
[Susan Malloy] It’s the blouse, maybe.

78
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:29,500
[Delaney Hall] Okay.

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
[Susan Malloy] Do you mind if I give you something else to wear?

80
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,750
[Delaney Hall] No, not at all.

81
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
[Susan Malloy] Okay. Well, I do have guest clothes.

82
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:36,750
[Delaney Hall] Okay.

83
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
[Roman Mars] Delaney is not a smoker, but this is the level of Susan’s sensitivity.

84
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,750
[Delaney Hall] Susan is at the heart of this community.

85
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,250
People have described her to me as a fairy god mother, and the queen.

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,750
She works with curious outsiders like me.

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:56,000
She also attends conferences on disability rights and spends hours each week answering phone calls from people who are sick.

88
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,500
She’s healthier than lots of her neighbors,

89
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,750
but that hasn’t always been the case.

90
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,250
[Susan Malloy] For me it was just real fast. I felt this,

91
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:08,000
just bizarre feeling in my head.

92
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:16,000
And my sinuses and the palette of my mouth and my throat all swelled closed.

93
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,250
[Delaney Hall] Susan was living in San Francisco when she first got sick,

94
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:23,250
back in the early 90’s. Her sensitivities began to cascade,

95
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,250
which is pretty typical for the illness.

96
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,000
Her allergy to chemicals grew in to a sensitivity to food and clothing,

97
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,500
then electricity. Telephones, computers, kitchen appliances.

98
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Pretty much everything became toxic to her.

99
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:40,500
[Susan Malloy] Furniture had to go, the rugs had to go.

100
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,750
I had two girlfriends come over and take my clothes.

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,250
Just got rid of almost everything right away.

102
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,750
[Delaney Hall] Susan slept on friends porches, in her car, and then at her parents’.

103
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,250
At her sickest,

104
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,500
she couldn’t even drink chemically treated tap water and her mom put buckets in the yard to gather rain.

105
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Then a friend with MCS invited her to visit Snowflake, a rural,

106
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,750
high altitude community with good, clean air.

107
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,500
He’d discovered it a few years before, driving around the country,

108
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,000
trying to find a place where his symptoms wouldn’t be so severe.

109
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,750
And when Susan visited…

110
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,750
[Susan Malloy] For me, the improvement was so radical. You know,

111
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:20,500
you get out of the car, you feel better. You can walk.

112
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,000
You don’t need the oxygen tank. Your speech is clear.

113
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,250
I didn’t exactly want to move here, but my body said yeah,

114
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:28,500
we’re moving here.

115
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,750
[Delaney Hall] For Susan, the move felt like a passage.

116
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,250
Like a journey between two different worlds.

117
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,000
[Susan Malloy] Like in the old days,

118
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,500
for someone to get on a ship and go to the United States from Ireland.

119
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,750
They didn’t really want to leave,

120
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:47,000
they just weren’t able to make it anymore and so they took this huge risk and got on a ship.

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,250
I think it felt a little like that to me.

122
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
[Roman Mars] Gradually, more people moved to Snowflake. They came from all over.

123
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,250
An engineer from Denmark, a marketing director from Toronto,

124
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,500
a chef from the Philippines, a teacher from San Francisco. Now,

125
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,750
there are about three dozen households scattered across this area,

126
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,750
all united by this illness.

127
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,000
[Delaney Hall] And they’re not the first people in history to move because of sickness.

128
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,500
[Susan Malloy] Forever,

129
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:19,250
there have's been people who’ve had to relocate because of particular medical problems or health reasons.

130
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,250
[Delaney Hall] In fact,

131
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:24,500
the history of medical migration to this part of the country goes back a long ways.

132
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:25,750
[Roman Mars] A hundred years ago,

133
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,250
doctors encouraged people with tuberculosis to head west for the same clean,

134
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,750
dry air that brought Susan here.

135
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:39,750
So many patients ended up in Arizona that tent cities sprouted up across the state and locals gave them a nickname: ‘lungers',

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
because of the hacking cough that characterized the illness.

137
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:47,500
[Susan Malloy] So this is not an uncommon experience for human beings.

138
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:51,000
Just right now’s our turn. We’re it. We’re the new guys.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,250
[Delaney Hall] But the complicated thing about this illness is that it’s so unknown.

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Some doctors would argue that this place isolates people,

141
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,750
pushes them deeper in to their sickness.

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,500
All the talk about diets and remedies and building techniques only reinforces what might be better treated in other ways.

143
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,250
But Susan told me this place saved her life.

144
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,750
[Susan Malloy] The kitchen’s the same as the bedroom which is the same as the living room.

145
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean I basically live in one big room.

146
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,000
[Delaney Hall] Susan built this house herself with help from friends.

147
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:27,500
[Roman Mars] The people here in Snowflake might be the closest thing there is to a MCS think-tank.

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,750
And they’ve developed building techniques that help manage their sensitivities.

149
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,500
That means using ‘safe materials’,

150
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,000
like ceramic tiles or concrete floors instead of carpeting,

151
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,750
which traps chemical odors.

152
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,000
[Delaney Hall] Susan also used foil-lined sheet rock, which covers her walls,

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,750
giving the whole inside of her house a silver sheen.

154
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,250
[Susan Malloy] I just couldn’t afford to risk paint. You know,

155
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,500
if you get the wrong kind of paint, your whole house is unlivable.

156
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,000
Maybe forever,

157
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
or maybe at least for several months or a couple years.

158
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:04,500
[Delaney Hall] But maybe the most striking thing about this house is the way that Susan has isolated most of her electronics in a separate room,

159
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,750
which she can completely shut off from the rest of the house.

160
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,250
That’s because many people with MCS also experience sensitivity to electricity.

161
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,000
So you designed it pretty strategically with that room in mind,

162
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,250
the room at the front of the house is the one that….

163
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,500
[Susan Malloy] The only electricity comes in to one corner of the house.

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,750
It all comes in right over there and the rest of the house doesn’t have to be as affected by it.

165
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,250
[Delaney Hall] She keeps her television and a VCR in a separate room and she’s constructed a thick window to watch TV through,

166
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,750
while keeping the equipment isolated.

167
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:46,000
[Susan Malloy] The television is an ancient one, I mean by today’s standards,

168
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,750
and it’s really nothing special other than it's old.

169
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,500
I don’t want to have new chemical emissions in my house you know from plastics and so forth if there’s any way around it.

170
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,250
And so this one is old and aired out,

171
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:09,750
and this glass sheet in front of it is to keep the fumes in that room.

172
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:17,250
And I can open the front door and let the fumes go out without contaminating the inside of my house.

173
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:23,500
[Delaney Hall] The house is modest but you can tell how much it means to Susan.

174
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,500
She shows me every corner and every adaptation. It’s her safe haven.

175
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:32,750
And there are lots of people who are desperate to move out here to live in a little place just like this.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,250
[Delaney Hall] When Susan’s phone rings, it’s usually not a good sign.

177
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,000
[Susan Malloy] I don’t get calls from people for whom everything is going great,

178
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,500
you know?

179
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,250
[Susan Malloy] Hello?

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,750
[Joan Robinson] Hi Susan, this is Joan Robinson. How are you?

181
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,250
[Susan Malloy] Hi!

182
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,000
[Joan Robinson] Do you know how (inaudible) is, um, available? Cause I, um,

183
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:55,000
could not being doing worse. And I’ve got to get out of here.

184
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,750
My skin -- I -- my skin is literally burning and bleeding from the pollution.

185
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,250
[Delaney Hall] Susan gets a few calls like this a week, from runners,

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
people who are moving from place to place,

187
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,750
trying to find somewhere that feels safe.

188
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,250
Snowflake isn’t the only community of its kind,

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,750
but it’s one of the largest and most established. Still,

190
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,250
that doesn’t mean there’s room for everyone.

191
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,000
[Susan Malloy] I’m sorry, but there is someone living there.

192
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,000
[Joan Robinson] Someone is living there?

193
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,500
[Delaney Hall] Susan tracks the limited housing in Snowflake and she breaks the bad news when she can’t help out.

194
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
[Joan Robinson] I don’t know, you never know. I’m waiting for a miracle to happen.

195
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,000
I need a miracle Susan, this is just incredible.

196
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,250
[Susan Malloy] I don’t have any miracles. I wish I did.

197
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,500
[Joan Robinson] I need to go. I know you’re not asking me to get off,

198
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
but I need to go cause I’m too emotional right now.

199
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,250
[Susan Malloy] I’m afraid that’s what a typical call is like. You know,

200
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,250
people who are real sick where they are and need to be in a...

201
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,250
another kind of housing, and there isn’t any.

202
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,000
[Roman Mars] Over the years,

203
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
enough people with MCS have come to Snowflake that the wider community has adapted to them.

204
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,250
At least a little bit.

205
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,750
[Delaney Hall] There’s a real estate agent who helps people find MCS friendly properties.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,750
There’s an organic food store,

207
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,000
which is kind of unusual for a rural town of 5,000.

208
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:23,500
The owner there will sometimes shop for people with MCS and leave the groceries outside for them to pick up so they don’t have to come into the store,

209
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,000
which smells like incense. And then there’s the dentist.

210
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,250
[Melissa] ...and my EI patients usually come in through the back door.

211
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:36,750
They wait in their cars, and we have a separate entrance, right here.

212
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,750
[Roman Mars] EI is short for Environmental Illness,

213
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
another term for Multiple Chemical Sensitivity.

214
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,750
[Delaney Hall] Melissa is a hygienist here at Sierra Dental.

215
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:54,000
Sierra Dental regularly sees about 40 patients with MCS and they’ve adapted their practice to make it friendly to people with sensitivities.

216
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,250
[Melissa] And I usually tend to see them at eight o’clock in the morning,

217
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
because that’s, um,

218
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,250
I haven’t wiped my room down with chemicals because I did it the night before.

219
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,250
So I don’t have to worry about them smelling the Cavicide wipes,

220
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,000
which is what we use in a dental office.
